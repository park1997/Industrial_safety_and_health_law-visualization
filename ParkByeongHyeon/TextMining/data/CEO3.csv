5,Asiana Airlines,1,Korea,"This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of Asiana Airlines since it embarked on its journey to a
brighter future. We are truly grateful to all stakeholders who have loved and rooted for us for the past 25 years. Thanks
to your support, Asiana Airlines was able to become the 1st airline to be named as the Airline of the Year for five
consecutive times.
Asiana Airlines has unwavering commitment to its responsibility as Beautiful Company that creates the best
corporate value in the industry, achieving customer satisfaction through the safest, superior service.
Despite adverse external conditions including the economic recession triggered by the developed countries and
spread to Korea, Asiana Airlines achieved positive performance by carrying more than 11million passengers for the
year, generating KRW 5 trillion 638.1 billion in revenue and KRW 132.5 billion in EBIT driven in part by the growth
of the Chinese market and increasing demand for leisure activities in 2012. In addition, Asiana has continued
introducing the latest equipment and facilities including nine passenger jets and two cargo jets to operate a total of
80 airplanes while upgrading plane seats and facilities for two Boeing 777 airplanes. Asiana also launched a flight to
Vladivostok completing the triangle route to the Far East by connecting it with the flights to Khabarovsk and Sakhalin,
and increased flights to Haneda, Hong Kong, Honolulu and Paris to increase customer convenience.
In parallel with this, Asiana Airlines has introduced a wide array of initiatives for a ¡®Beautiful World¡¯ to create prosperity
for everyone. The company is faithfully complying with 10 principles of the UN Global Compact on various issues
such as human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption while expanding the scope of Eco-Flight, the distinct
green operation program of the company, and promoting a family-friendly work environment and inclusive growth. It
is also making remarkable strides in social contribution, with initiatives that go beyond the national boundary such as
donating books to multi-cultural families in Korea, opening ¡®Beautiful Class¡¯ to sister schools in China, and launching
the ¡®Love House¡¯ initiative in Vietnam. Such strenuous endeavor has earned Asiana the recognition as no.1 airline
in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for four consecutive years, the grand prize at the 1st Family Friendly Employer
Award, and the no. 1 airline in the Korean Sustainability Index.
Going forward, Asiana people will exert their best endeavors, building on its achievement during the past 25 years
to fly beyond the competition. We hope all stakeholders to continue to give their support on our journey towards the
beautiful future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Asiana Airlines,2,Korea,"Since the inception, Asiana Airlines has pledged and practiced the highest standards of safety and
service that can truly satisfy our customers. The best safety and service are the two non-negotiable,
core values and capabilities of Asiana Airlines. We always strive to receive strong trust from our
customers.
Nowadays, the aviation industry, both domestic and global market, is going through severe
competition. Uncertainty is growing due to persistently high oil price, increased volatility of exchange
rates, and others. Also, declining market share of FSC(Full Service Carrier) due to the aggressive
sales strategy of LCC(Low Cost Carrier) and lackluster performances of major economies are dealing
a double whammy. Under such circumstance, Asiana Airlines has worked really hard to respond to
external changes more flexibly while playing to its strengths to better the company competitiveness.
In 2013, Asiana Airlines introduced eight new aircrafts(A330, A321, B777, etc) to augment its aircraft
fleet, increased Gimpo-Jeju flights to accommodate rapidly increasing Chinese tourists, flexibly
operating flights to Chicago, Seattle and Honolulu, and regular extra cargo flights to Hong Kong.
There were other endeavors to increase profitability such as extending partnerships, expanding sales
channels(Internet, mobile, etc) and leveraging high popularity of Korean culture or joint marketing
campaigns.
For safer flight operation, the flight crew training and evaluation scheme has been reinforced, Safety
Security Office has been upgraded to the level of head office, and aviation safety experts have
been newly hired. In August 2013, Asiana Airlines opened a second hangar in Incheon which has
the largest-ever scale and cutting-edge maintenance facilities to upgrade the corporate capability to
conduct inspection and maintenance while at the same time measuring up to the global standards
on maintenance quality.
Under the slogan ¡®Fly Together in this Beautiful World¡¯, Asiana Airlines has implemented various
socially responsible initiatives based on four core topics such as Better Education, Culture of Sharing,
Green Management, and Art & Culture Sponsorship. For a greener earth, the company has introduced
airplanes with better fuel efficiency that can minimize energy consumption and driven technologically
proven CO2 reduction initiatives to be recognized as green-friendly airline that can also take care of
our precious nature and the earth.
Asiana Airlines successfully overcame both internal and external challenges of 2013, improved overall
business efficiency for sustainable growth, and reinforced the business competitiveness. Now 2014
will be the year renew our determination like we are starting all over again. In 2014 and onwards,
Asiana people ? both executives and employees alike ? will fully commit themselves to continuing
the sustainable growth, increasing contribution to environment and society by leveraging the
company¡¯s financial performance. We hope all of our stakeholders to continue to give support and
encouragement on our journey towards the beautiful future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Asiana Airlines,3,Korea,"All of us will do our best without stopping for sustainable growth and development. First of all, I would like to convey my sincere appreciation to our stakeholders for continued affection and trust. In the last year, we were able to reinforce our core competency and competitiveness under  he motto of ¡®new Kumho Asiana¡¯. These achievements were made possible because of the assionnd unwavering focus which we learned in our early years. We chose ¡®Flawless Operational Safety¡¯ and ¡®Regaining Customer Trust¡¯ as our top priorities because safety and service are Asiana Airlines¡¯ highest goals. We¡¯ve made improvements in flight training system and maintenance quality system to reinforce our general safety systems. Aisana Airlines has introduced A380, the next generation cutting-edge aircraft, to provide convenience for customers and put them into lA flights. In order to reinforce the competitiveness of long-haul flights, we  expanded Paris and Istanbul flights. Furthermore, we added more flights to Guangzhou, yanji and Shenzhen to take the dominance as a leading carrier in the Chinese market. Asiana Airlines has laid the groundwork for sustainability with the revitalization of organizational culture. ¡®Smile brings blessings¡¯ campaign, the meeting between executives and staffers which leads to frank exchanges of opinions, has given us the sense of belonging and strong bond by tearing down the walls between positions. Asiana Airlines is going to fulfill the management policy of the last year, new Kumho Asiana, in 2015 and will try its best to be a reliable and beautiful company under the new motto ¡°Strengthen Self without Stopping¡±. That means we are ready to stand as one and work tirelessly for the steady development and growth of the company. In addition to the safety and service items we have already promoted, an integrated safety information system will be built and bold investment for hi-tech operation equipment will be made to continuously strengthen the infrastructure for safety. This will also enhance the foundation for bringing about the awareness of safety issues. In order to reinforce our competitiveness through the latest aircraft, we confirmed the plan to introduce A350XWb and A321 nEO. We hope this will help build up the foundation for future growth. This year, we will put additional A380s into new york flights and will start a new flight to Rome to reinforce our competitiveness in long-haul flight. Also, we will speed up the plan to add our strategic air routes in China and other Asian countries. Asiana Airlines hopes to become a company that contributes to the nation and society by social and environmental activities. We are going to take responsibility for social and environmental issues with persistence and sincerity. One of such efforts is the ¡®unICEF Spare Coin Collection¡¯ which we has been working with the Korean Committee for unICEF (united nations Children¡¯s Fund). In the last year, the accumulated amount of money has exceeded 10 billion won. This fundraising campaign will be continued for the benefit of underprivileged children. There are also other activities and campaigns to promote corporate responsibility such as ¡®Social Work Volunteering In Relay¡¯, ¡®beautiful Classroom¡¯ in China, tree planting events on the reclaimed lands near metropolitan areas and various environmental activities to reduce greenhouse gases. In retrospect, Asiana Airlines has grown and evolved thanks to our stakeholders¡¯ continuous affection and support. We will make utmost efforts to raise the corporate value to the best in the business and to be a ¡®beautiful Company¡¯who is willing to take the social responsibilities by raising awareness of safety issues and differentiating the services with distinct ideas. We hope all our stakeholders will favor us with supports and expectations. Thank you.

503,Asiana Airlines,4,Korea,"First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude toward everyone who provides continuous support and trust
to us at Asiana Airlines.
With the management policy focused on persistent effort, during the past year, Asiana Airlines strove to become
a beautiful and powerful company by reinforcing its core competence as well as restructuring and continuous
innovation. We added two A380 aircrafts to our major routes, New York and Los Angeles, for safe and comfortable
journey of our customers, and confirmed a plan to introduce and operate aircrafts, A350 for mid-to-long routes and
A32NEO for short routes, in order to establish efficient and competitive fleet. In addition, we launched new routes
to Rome and Astana, and added flights to Chinese cities including Yancheng, Guilin, Chongqing, and Chengdu.
Furthermore, we launched a FOQA (flight operations quality assurance) committee in which both the management
and labor participate, and reinforced our evaluation and safety teams for flight training in order to improve the quality
and safety of flight training.
The management policy of Asiana Airlines for the year 2016 is summarized as ¡®Back to the Founding Spirit¡¯ which
suggests we will renew Asiana Airlines by bringing back the passion and determination the company had when it
was founded.
Again, this year, we will introduce two more A380 aircrafts in order to reinforce our competitiveness in long-distance
flights with a total of six A380s, Air Seoul, which was launched earlier this year, will cooperate with Asiana Airlines
and Air Busan, maximizing the synergy effect. Also, like last year, we will enhance our competitiveness through
efficient organizational management, strategic route operation, improved aircraft competitiveness, and enhanced
system, as well as continue to establish the sustainable base and invest in safety through integrated safety
management system, etc.
We are planning to engage more actively in reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission by
optimizing fuel use, reducing flight fuel costs, and cleaning the engines, and strive to perform our role as a beautiful
company by sharing the talent and knowledge of Asiana Airlines staff through our Social Responsibility brand
¡®Beautiful Classroom¡¯ and themed activities.
We believe the value of a corporation in being the top in the industry does not lie in simply making profit but in
sharing it with all stakeholders and moving forward with them.
All staff of Asiana Airlines will continue to make effort so that we can grow as a beautiful company that is trusted and
practices sustainable growth. We hope to see your continuous support and trust for a long time.

11,BNK Financial Group Inc.,3,Korea,"Since the establishment of Busan Bank in 1967 that has matured
with the local regions, BNK Financial Group was launched
in 2011. The group has leaped higher as Korea¡¯s representative
regional financial group with seven affiliates in a space of merely
four years.
With the incorporation of Kyongnam Bank last October, we established
a two-bank system. As a result, we have solidified our
presence as one of Korea¡¯s top five financial groups with total
assets of KRW 93 trillion, 8,000 employees and 500 branches as
of end-2014.
The corporate title was changed from ¡®BS Financial Group¡¯ into
¡®BNK Financial Group¡¯ because 'BS' might be understood as
geographically confined to Busan, while BNK as an acronym for
¡®Beyond No.1 Korea¡¯and 'Busan and Kyongnam'. This will push us
to move forward to become a 'Global Super Regional Financial
Group'.
We have intensified the scope and depth of the Happiness with
You project that has cemented its presence as an iconic brand
of BNK Financial Group while leading socially responsible management
practices in the financial sector from 2012. As such,
we are committed to practicing noblesse oblige befitting the
higher prestige of BNK Financial Group.
This year¡¯s corporate slogan for BNK Financial Group is ¡®Giving
Hope through Happiness¡®. Accordingly, we plan to extend
financial services that give hope to local communities and
customers by scaling up the creative finance, and initiating
region-focused social contribution projects that have stories to
tell and touch the hearts of people.
We aim to create our exclusive differentiated values by selecting
the following action plans according to our management principle
of ¡®Great Innovation 2015 ? Forward-looking Management
System¡¯ in order to establish the basis for sustainable growth.
First, we will secure engines for sustainable growth by carrying
out distinctive strategies. We will establish our unparalleled
stature as a leading regional financial group, and boost our
roles as a financial group specialized in Busan as the mecca of
finance. Seeking to tap into oversea markets where the group¡¯s
future growth engines lie, we will initiate optimized business
model strategies in Asia through cross-affiliate collaboration
and enable business localization in a preemptive manner.
Second, we will concentrate on intensifying profitability and
management efficiency based on solid management driven
by stable growth. Based on strategies that focus on profitability
and soundness, all-out efforts will be underway to boost the
competencies of all affiliates by exploring new businesses for
each affiliate, diversifying income sources, maximizing synergies
and establishing a profit-oriented organization.
Lastly, we will practice distinctive socially responsible management
to serve as the most trusted financial partner. We
will dramatically upgrade the 'Happiness with You' project that
has been maintained for the past three years, and take the lead
in creating values to be shared in the financial industry. Projects
to support the creative finance and facilitation of the regional
economies including technology financing, relationship finance
and job creation will be further explored and initiated as we do
the utmost to fulfill social responsibilities for regional communities
and residents.
BNK Financial Group promises to rise as the most exemplary
holding company model that has grown into a world-class financial
group originating from local regions. This will be driven
by the core value of ¡°Dynamic¡±,¡°Glocal¡±,¡°Partnership¡± symbolized
by BNK and its new CI, and the management motto to grow
higher i.e., ¡®To the world with the region and to a better future

504,BNK Financial Group Inc.,4,Korea,"In March 2011, BNK Financial Group was launched as a financial holdings company for the first time as a regional bank. We incorporated Kyongnam
Bank as an affiliate in 2014, and BNK Asset Management as another affiliate in 2015, thereby comprising eight affiliates with total assets of
KRW 100 trillion. We have established our presence by being ranked Korea¡¯s fifth largest financial group. BNK Financial Group was incorporated
into the Asia-Pacific Index of the world¡¯s most renowned Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) associated with sustainability. Moreover, we
were ranked 178th among the World¡¯s Top 250 Safest Banks, and 3rd among domestic banks by The Banker, thereby indicating our acceptance

First, we will solidify ¡®a system for sustainable growth¡¯ through great innovation.
While launching ¡®SUM Bank¡¯, a mobile bank in the group level last March, we dramatically strengthened the group¡¯s future competitiveness
by establishing a customer-oriented business and face-to-face and non-face-to-face omni-channels using fin-tech including big data and
non-face-to-face certification. We will also beef up the fundamentals of the group to turn crises into opportunities through continued
efficiency in corporate management.
Second, we will secure a differentiated basis for growth exclusive to BNK Financial Group by gathering competencies of affiliates.
We will maximize cross-affiliate synergies throughout our business in the group level by strengthening the group¡¯s roles as a control tower.
We will take closer steps to ¡®completing a financial triangle in Asia¡¯, a mid-and long-term vision for global businesses by implementing
success models in our overseas market entry, especially focusing on Busan Bank and BNK Capital.
Lastly, we will take the lead in creating a world of love by spearheading socially responsible management in the financial sector.
We will establish systematic strategies for socially responsible management and initiate the expansion of differentiated social contribution
projects to upgrade our ¡®Happy Finance¡¯ projects that have been carried on since 2012. We will enhance customers¡¯ happiness and trust by fully
enforcing righteousness and ethical management as well as the protection of financial consumers which are required of a financial group.

12,BPA,3,Korea,"I am pleased to introduce various sustainable management activities of
Busan Port Authority (BPA) by publishing the first Sustainability Report.
Since its founding in 2004, BPA has played a pivotal role in developing,
managing, and operating Busan Port to make it into one of the world¡¯s best
hub ports. BPA has contributed to developing the national economy and
strived to provide customers with the best-quality services by carrying out
major projects such as the construction of Busan New Port and redevelopment
of North Port.
As the global shipping industry has faced various challenges such as the
appearance of new carriers, enlargement of vessels, and intensified competition
among major ports, BPA has proactively taken appropriate measures
such as establishing marketing strategies for each alliance, opening a representative
office in Europe, and conducting customized marketing activities
for each shipping company. Thanks to these ceaseless efforts, BPA has
achieved surplus net income for 11 consecutive years, being placed as the
6th largest port in terms of cargo volume by handling 18.68 million containers
in 2014. BPA is the 3rd largest port, handling 942 cargo transshipments,
which demonstrates our global competitiveness in the shipping
industry.
BPA was selected as the best public corporation in improving slack
management by significantly reforming welfare and benefit schemes. In
addition, we were recognized as the best public corporation in the assessment
for comprehensive integrity by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights
Commission for two consecutive years. This performance has allowed us to
gain solid trust of people. Moreover, we have not only reinforced fairness
and transparency in transactions through improving relevant systems but
achieved shared growth by promoting cooperation with business partners,
supporting their sales channel expansion, and upgrading business environment.
As part of the strategies for transforming Busan Port into a green port, BPA
has carried out the E-RTGC project since 2007, changing the energy source
of tire-type yard cranes (RTGC) from diesel to electricity, with the aim of
reducing the amount of pollutants discharged in the process of cargo handling.
Furthermore, BPA started test operation to replace the energy source
of yard tractors from diesel to LNG in order to make Busan Port environmentally
friendly.
With the introduction of the Environmental Ship Index (ESI), BPA induces
voluntary participation of shipping companies by reducing port entry
and departure fees based on eco-friendly index of vessels entering Busan
Port. Other environmental achievements include obtaining certification of
eco-friendly buildings for the International Passenger Terminal and recycling
waste in the process of port construction.
In the aspect of social activities, BPA launched a social contribution brand
¡®Happy Ocean¡¯ to raise public awareness of its social contribution activities
and conducted various activities suitable for its characteristics such as the
Marine Sports Experience Camp for the Youth, Busan Port Love event, and
Integrated Safety Experience event for the Youth. Through these extensive
efforts, BPA has won the ¡®Grand Prize for Education Contribution in Korea¡¯
from the Ministry of Education and the ¡®Mecenat Tower¡¯ award from the
Busan Metropolitan City for three consecutive years, and has been highly
recognized for its excellence in social contribution activities.
With the aim of achieving a qualitative growth to generate added value,
BPA will leap forward and become a prestigious port by realizing the ¡®Busan
Port Vision 2030.¡¯ This vision includes solidifying its status as the world¡¯s 3rd
largest transshipment port by increasing the proportion of transshipment
up to 60% and generating regional economic impact worth KRW 7.7 trillion
by nurturing various kinds of port businesses. On the pursuit of its new
vision, BPA will reinforce its social responsibility in various sectors, not only
in social contribution, but also in integrity, ethical management, port safety,
and shared growth by solidifying its leading role as a public corporation.
To maintain its status as a global hub port, BPA will not only overcome the
challenge environment but also share higher value with its stakeholders by
continuously carrying out innovation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We believe that only a company that steadily raises its corporate value can contribute to
customers and communities. Despite the challenging situations such as the economic downturn
in Korea and fiercer competitions between financial companies, we made an achievement of
increasing total assets over 10% last year. Even profitability went down year-on-year, it is a higher
outcome than expected given the economic circumstances. Capital adequacy was maintained
at the level of world-class financial groups, securing an unyielding management basis against
external shocks.

15,CJ,1,Korea,"Greetings to our valued stakeholders,
The year 2012 was a challenging year in terms of the business environment at home and abroad amidst difficult global and domestic economic conditions.
Despite such demanding management conditions, CJ CheilJedang achieved meaningful results for sustainable management thanks to the support
and interest of our stakeholders.
Global No.1 Food & Bio Company
With increases in sales in all business areas, CJ CheilJedang achieved sales of KRW 7.1 trillion and operating income of KRW 501.1 billion in 2012, up 8.7%
and 9% from the previous year, respectively excluding CJ Korea Express. In the global market, the company further consolidated market dominance in
the bio business sector, while earning 65% of the feed and livestock¡¯s revenue in overseas markets . On the domestic front, CJ CheilJedang further solidified
our market share in leading processed food products, while enhancing profitability in the foodstuffs business and our pharma divison achieved the
highest level of sales growth in the industry.

Korea, CJ CheilJedang has introduced a green management system and implemented it throughout the business units of the company. In order to respond
to the issue of global climate change, the company operates the energy innovation committee, participates in carbon information disclosure programs
and carbon labelling system, and develops eco-friendly packaging materials. In addition, CJ CheilJedang was the nation¡¯s first food company to participate
in green partnership among large, medium and small enterprises, thereby supporting partner companies¡¯ energy innovation activities and their establishment
of a carbon management system. Meanwhile, the company continues its efforts to reduce environmental pollution implementing internal standards,
more stringent than those required by the government regulations.
Joy of growing together with Stakeholders
Based on the three principles of sincerity, continuity and practical assistance, CJ Cheiljedang is engaged in win-win management activities for our
stakeholders, including customers(companies), suppliers, the local community and employees. Launching a collaborative product brand ¡°Joy of growing

value.
First of all, we have laid a foundation for stable growth through an increase of the overall percentage
of overseas projects in our business and diversification of order portfolios. We have
also made every effort to conduct risk management and reduce costs for practical growth of the
company. In terms of environmental sustenance, we have consistently controlled the greenhouse

company by having 6 green construction technologies certified by the government.
In order to put shared growth into practice, which was the biggest issue in 2012, we have
maintained strong and consistent partnerships with suppliers and provided support for mutual
prosperity. We have also made every effort to develop construction projects from a customer's
perspective and to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction in order to consistently
earn their trust. Internally, we continue to endeavor to create a trustworthy corporate culture by
implementing diverse welfare systems and expanding employee training programs to enhance
human resources. In addition, we achieved the lowest industrial accident rate in the construction
industry in 2012 by considering the health and safety of the employees to be our top priority.

growth and development of Daelim Industrial last year.
Daelim diversified overseas markets and strengthened its position as a key player in the plant business by
winning the Fast Track Project 3A in Malaysia and Oman's Sohar Refinery Improvement Project in 2013 despite
difficult market environment. We also laid the foundation for actively entering the overseas IPP market
as a global developer by acquiring a stake in Millmerran Power Station in Australia.
In terms of environmental sustenance, Daelim has succeeded in reducing the amount of greenhouse
gas emissions by 22% through continuous control, and signed a pilot project for the Target Management

has played a central role in our nation¡¯s economic development by participating in the construction of various social
infrastructure, environmentally friendly residential and non-residential buildings, generation¡¤industrial facilities and more.
In 2012, in spite of the global economic downturn and a stagnant construction market, Daewoo E&C recorded stable
economic accomplishments of orders of 13.8124 trillion KRW, 8.1803 trillion KRW in sales, and operating profit of 365.2
billion KRW. In response to the stagnant domestic construction market, we turned our focus on strategically expanding
our presence in foreign markets. As a result, we were able to build a stable business portfolio with 46.1% of new orders
and 42.0% of sales coming from foreign markets. Through synergy with Korea Development Bank, we were able to reduce
the cost of financing, strengthen financial stability, and develop new business models. Furthermore, we were also able to
enhance project management efficiency through the development of the integrated construction management system.
We systematically incorporated our commitment to building economic, social and environmental value throughout our
business process by developing a firm-wide sustainable management structure. Enhancing our environment, waste and
GHG emissions inventory IT system and pursuing win-win management by expanding support for and communication with
our partner companies were some of our efforts in this respect. We also published our first corporate sustainability report in
September 2012 to share our accomplishments and goals for the future with our stakeholders.
With EPC Innovation at the core of our business, Daewoo E&C and its employees are
striving to come together to build the foundation for sustained growth.
2013 commemorates the 40th anniversary of Daewoo E&C¡¯s founding and is also an important turning point for us. We are
facing unprecedented difficulties with a constricted construction market and intensifying competition. In light of this business
environment, we have adopted EPC Innovation (Efficiency, Process, Cost) as our core business focus, ¡®Maximizing Business
Value through Change and Innovation¡¯ as our business principle and plan to proceed with ¡®Responsible Management, Talent
Management and Value Management¡¯ as our implementation strategy. To do this, we have entered into an emergency
management system with all our employees unified towards the goal of building a foundation for sustained growth.
All Daewoo E&C employees are working concertedly to strengthen our capacity for sustainable management by building
systems for ethical management, customer satisfaction management, corporate philanthropy, safety management and
environmental management. In addition, we will continue to strengthen our corporate responsibility as a member of the
UN Global Compact, by strictly applying the 10 principles governing human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.
Furthermore, we will publish our corporate social responsibility report on an annual basis and diversify the channels of
communications allowing for broader communications with you, our stakeholders.

20,Daewoo E&C,2,Korea,"I extend my gratitude to all those who have supported Daewoo E&C through the years. 2013 brought a slower pace in global economic recovery and a prolonged decline in the domestic construction market. With the stagnant Korean onstruction market and heated competition in foreign markets, we at Daewoo E&C struggled to retain profitability, which is reflected in the slump in our business performance for the year. As such, all of us at Daewoo E&C are consolidating our capabilities to overcome these difficulties and create a new launch pad for growth. To achieve this, we have been working continuously towards cost innovation and are focusing on maximizing profitability and liquidity through a strategy of selection and concentration in winning contracts. Led by the ¡®Corporate Value Committee¡¯ launched in 2014, we have been securing internal stability and establishing a new corporate culture. In addition, we are consolidating sustainable operations by making our firm-wide risk management system more sophisticated with the newly expanded RM Division. We have selected international operations, technological competitiveness, developing and managing construction talent, creating economic value, environment-friendly construction, shared growth, customer satisfaction, and ethical?transparent management as the 8 core issues impacting Daewoo E&C¡¯s sustainable management. These issues are monitored and managed methodically. Furthermore, the progress we have made in these fields are disclosed with transparency in this report to enhance
our communication with you, our stakeholders. Today, companies can no longer expect continued growth in financial performance without fulfilling their social and environmental responsibilities. In response to the needs of the time, we announced the ¡®Daewoo New-Way¡¯ in November 2013, commemorating our 40th anniversary with compliance in corporate social, environmental and ethical responsibilities. This has fueled our efforts towards changing the way we think and innovating the way we work to establish an ethical and transparent corporate culture. As Korea¡¯s representative construction company, we can¡¯t stress enough that each member of the Daewoo E&C family work with the utmost ethical mindset. We are strengthening our ethics policies to eradicate all corruption and illegal activities, and we strive to achieve shared growth with our business partners through fair trade policies.

21,Daewoo E&C,3,Korea,"Though the domestic construction market was partly revived by the government¡¯s reflation
measures for the real estate business, global conditions continued to lag with the prolonged
economic depression and the ever-fluctuating oil prices and exchange rates. Yet, Daewoo E&C
not only made a successful turnaround but also accomplished one of the best management
performances among Korean construction companies. The success would not have been possible
without your support and encouragement, and in turn, Daewoo E&C promises our continuous
growth.
In 2015, we will actively secure a well-balanced portfolio - regionally and functionally - in
order to enable steady growth in spite of external changes. We expect to obtain quality projects
in emerging markets such as Algeria, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait; win more contracts for civil
engineering infrastructure and Independent Power Plant (IPP) projects in Southern Africa as a
strategic counterplan to the possible decrease of projects for plant construction in the Middle East
region due to the fall of oil prices; and sustain efforts to pioneer new markets in Ghana and in
Mozambique. We will strive to ensure profitability in the early stages of obtaining orders through
risk management and active deliberation, both of which were significantly strengthened in 2014,
whilst innovating production costs and reducing selling and administrative expenses.
Nowadays, companies can no longer achieve financial growth without fulfilling their social
and environmental responsibilities. Fully acknowledging the trend, Daewoo E&C embraced the
¡®DAEWOO New-Way¡¯ in 2013 to strengthen ethics policies and structures, as well as putting
our best efforts into mutual growth with suppliers via fair trade. We also focus on transparent
communication with our stakeholders by publicly disclosing Daewoo E&C¡¯s most pressing issues
within our sustainability reports.
Relating to the growing importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), in February 2015,
Daewoo E&C introduced the Compliance Program (CP) to raise our credit ratings and to minimize
compliance risks. Through the CP, we intend on shifting employee awareness as well as preventing
corruption and/or other unreasonable business practices, thereby becoming an exemplary leading
company.
2015 shall serve as a foothold for Daewoo E&C¡¯s yet another leap forward, especially after
the surplus we reached in 2014. In light of our promising future, I would like to ask you, our
stakeholders, for your continuous interest and support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
508,Daewoo E&C,4,Korea,"In 2015, despite the intense competition domestically within
the construction market in Korea and the decline of overseas
construction markets due to low oil prices, Daewoo E&C
achieved considerably satisfactory performance compared to
our industry peers thanks to the rapid reorganization of our
business portfolio in advance. By winning the S-Oil RUC and
Kuwait Al-Zour Refinery construction, we were able to line up a
system of all business types with engineering and construction.
Also, the Compliance Program was implemented to enable all
employees to have law-abiding consciousness in performing
their work, and these efforts were acknowledged internally
and externally by being the only Korean construction company
ranked at 19th place within the ¡®2015 Asia Sustainability
Ranking¡¯ that announced the sustainability performance of
companies in the Asian Region.
Through continuous sales growth and efforts to reduce the
overall cost in the first half of 2016, Daewoo E&C was able
to improve its financial structure. However, the uncertain
internal and external business environment is expected to be
unfavorable regardless of the business area or type. Along with
the unstable macroeconomics, such as Brexit and the possibility
of the US raising the interest rate, the continuous low oil price
is expected to result in the decrease in the order from oilproducing
countries in the Middle East and Africa, restructuring
of construction companies by the government, and decrease in
the housing business to continue the phase of low-growth.
The unfavorable domestic and foreign environment mentioned
above are requiring tough challenges, but Daewoo E&C, which
is aiming for the people & better tomorrow, will pursue the
¡®Global Infra & Energy Developer¡¯ by 2025 based on our DNA
of successfully overcoming the past crisis and challenges, and
the experience of being Korea¡¯s No. 1 construction company.
To fulfill this goal, Daewoo E&C will improve its financial
stability by reinforcing business profitability, strengthening the
efficiency and productivity of the organizational operation,
establishing trust based on ethics, and practicing true talent
management.
First is the improvement of the financial stability by reinforcing
business profitability.
Rather than the practice of simple construction, we will focus
on improving the profitability by creating the high value-added

22,Daum Communications,1,Korea,"2012 was a difficult year with the impact of the European financial crisis of 2011
spreading throughout the global economy and stunting general market growth.
However, the online advertising market was able to grow compared to the previous
year despite these economic difficulties due to an increase in demand for
cost-efficient advertising.
Daum¡¯s online advertising business also was able to continue growth based on
successful mobile advertising. In addition, we were able to not only enter the
online game market smoothly with the acquisition of ¡®OnNet¡¯ but recorded great results while our special services during
the election season including online fund-raising and declaration of support, which sought the possibility for development
into a platform for digital democracy political culture, received positive feedback from our users. With these efforts, Daum
recorded 453.4 billion won in sales in 2012, an increase of 7.6% compared to the previous year and our highest sales ever.
In 2013, Daum successfully transformed to our independent search advertisement platform, and has established an
integrated network advertising platform based on our management know-how of operating ¡®AD@m¡¯, a mobile network
display advertising platform. With these efforts, we plan to cultivate a comprehensive advertising network environment
that can respond to diversifying device trends, satisfy the needs of advertisers, and also provide a service that can please
our users and various network partners.
Daum has a business history of growing together with our partners through advertising networks and the distribution of
contents. The business platform that has been gradually built over the past four years has been expanded to various offline
digital media, from PCs to mobile devices to TVs, for the foundation of the establishment of an optimized N Screen
network. Daum will continue our research and efforts for new business models according to the changing business environment
and will prioritize investment. Furthermore, 2013 is expected to be a year of fierce competition regarding services
and business to take initiative in the mobile market. Based on the past three years that Daum has worked to respond to
the N Screen era, we will be concentrating even more on mobile devices and services.
Greater sales as a result of our efforts and the creation of moderate profits rather than a blind pursuit of maximum profits
will be our foundation for becoming a ¡®sustainable company¡¯ that is committed to our mission, ¡®Bringing joyful changes
to the world¡¯.
Daum first released our ¡®Sustainability Report¡¯ in 2010, and by publishing it annually we have been sharing our efforts and
accomplishment for greater sustainability with our stakeholders. The 2013 ¡®Sustainability Report¡¯ was released online and
published in pdf version, and has included special reports on Daum¡¯s efforts to improve accessibility for a more ¡®joyful¡¯
internet world for all.
As a model company pioneering ¡®joyful changes to the world¡¯, Daum promises to continue communication and share
growth with our stakeholders, and kindly ask for the attention and support of our stakeholders. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,DGB (The Daegu Bank Ltd),1,Korea,"DGB Financial Group has an enduring commitment to be a regionally based comprehensive
financial group. To that end, our group has been accumulating and
integrating the competencies of our subsidiaries ? DGB Capital, U-Payment, Daegu
Credit Information, and the DGB Data System.
In the short span of two years after its founding on May 17, 2011 and amid the
lingering uncertainties in both the domestic and global financial environments, DG
Financial Group has continued its contributions to the vitalization of the local economy
and small-loan financing, and has focused its resources on establishing the
foundation for the group¡¯s synergy businesses. As a result, we have maintained a
stable and steady growth, and recorded a 0.83% return on assets (ROA), a 11.35%
return on equity (ROE), a 1.04% nonperforming loan ratio (NPL Ratio), and total assets
of 37,865.1 billion won in 2012. Notably, in recognition of accomplishing solid
financial performances and promoting sustainability management last year, we
were listed on the ¡¸2012 Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes - Asia Pacific (DJSI Asia
Pacific) and Korea¡¹ for 3 and 4 years in a row. In addition, we were selected as the
leading financial company for climate change information disclosure in the ¡¸2012
Carbon Information Disclosure Project (CDP Korea)¡¹ for the 4th consecutive year, and
also became the first in the financial sector to win the grand prize (Presidential Citation)
at the ¡¸2013 Korea Green Management Awards¡¹. These accomplishments
have raised the prestige and credential of our financial group a notch higher, which
faithfully strives towards our company¡¯s social responsibility.
On a foundation based on this continuous growth, DGB Financial Group has set
this year¡¯s management goal as, ¡®Yes we can! Pushing the boundaries and taking
a step forward¡¯. We will continue our commitment in growing hand-in-hand with
various stakeholders, such as our customers and stakeholders, local communities,
and employees. In this respect, the following initiatives have been put in place to
support our commitment to becoming a comprehensive financial group.
First, we will endeavor to identify and develop new growth platforms in various
fields, in a bid to secure the future competitiveness of our group. We will
continuously look out for new product opportunities, as well as tapping into
new markets and customers by making improvements to our financial service
and reinforcing market dominance in the established local communities.
Second, we will implement a more sales-oriented structure to streamline and increase
the flexibility of our sales branches against the changing business
landscape. We will incorporate differentiated marketing strategies, and
carry out direct sales to customers.
Third, we will further strengthen the group¡¯s synergy by expanding internal communication
channels and taking on challenges together with our subsidiaries.
We will forge collaboration to jointly develop new financial products
and enhance sales activities among the subsidiaries. Our concerted efforts
for the maximization of the group¡¯s synergy will continue into the future.
Fourth, we will reemphasize the importance of ethical management and put it
into practice. Ethical management focuses on the protection of financial
customers by establishing itself on legal principles and socially accepted
moral codes. We regard this as the cornerstone for achieving sustainability
management, and we will incorporate it as the beautiful corporate culture
of DGB Financial Group.
The 2012/2013 Sustainability Report, published by DGB Financial Group, is created
in accordance with the international standards of social responsibility (ISO26000)
and the GRI G3.1 Guidelines. It reflects the opinions of various stakeholders, including
shareholders, customers, local communities, partner companies, and employees.
We strive to be transparent in disclosing our actions to fulfill the UN Global Compact¡¯s
10 Principles.
This year¡¯s report contains the initiative to fulfill our role and responsibilities to
the economy, society, and environment. We are also determined to transparently
disclose our visions, goals, major execution strategies, and activities for sustainability
management, while faithfully implementing them. Going forward, we will
continue to practice sustainability management that meets global standards, as
well as listening to the voices of our stakeholders. In our endeavor to become a
world class regional bank that shares its dreams and prosperity with the local community,
I humbly ask all our stakeholders for your continued, unwavering support
and encouragement.

24,DGB (The Daegu Bank Ltd),2,Korea,"I became the second chairman of DGB Financial Group in March 2014,
a time when the group was entering the third year in operation since its
launch as a financial group with an ambitious plan to become a regionally
based comprehensive financial group. I remain committed to creating a
sustainability management system for the group and a brighter future as a
regionally-based leading financial group.
In retrospect, the business environment around DGB Financial Group
posed many challenges, such as the prolonged low-growth ¡¤ lowinterest
rate trends, fierce competition in the financial industry and
stricter regulations in 2013. However, our 4,000 employees were able
to overcome such difficulties by turning risks and changes into growth
opportunities. As a result, the group was able to sustain sound growth
based on stable fundamentals, posting a 0.65 percent return on assets
(ROA), a 8.63 percent return on equity (ROE), and a 1.04 percent nonperforming
loan ratio (NPL Ratio), with total assets reaching KRW 42
trillion and net income KRW 238.3 billion for 2013. Of particular note
was that we won several international awards in 2013 in recognition of
our exemplary sustainability management practices. To name a few, we
were listed on the 2013 Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Asia-Pacific
and DJSI Korea for four and five consecutive years, respectively, as well
as The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 4Good Index Series for a
third straight year. Furthermore, we also earned the highest AA grade
in our 2013 Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) Performance
Assessment.
Taking the helm of DGB Financial Group, I put forward the management
philosophy of practical management and set the 2014 vision of becoming
the best partner to our stakeholders. This means that we will strive to
become a leading corporate citizen, one that satisfies the economic
expectations of its customers, shareholders, investors and employees, as
well as take the lead in the development of society and environmentallyconscious
local communities. To that end, we have developed the
following three initiatives.
First, I will practice management by walking about (MBWA) as everything
that really matters is in the field. Putting customer value before everything
else, we will provide the best possible products and services to our
customers through customer-oriented management approaches, while
also developing innovative marketing infrastructure and policies in order
to resolve any complaints and better reflect suggestions made by our staff
in the field.
Second, we will become a trustworthy financial partner to our customers
and society through appropriate management practices. As witnessed in
the recent customer information leakage scandal in the domestic financial
sector, negligence can cause a financial institution to lose the trust of its
customers; a lethal blow for a financial institution. Acutely aware of this,
we will go back to basics and review our information security practices in
order to ensure customer information and financial consumer protection
practices are air-tight. Furthermore, we will continue to fulfill our social
responsibilities through various programs and volunteer activities.
Last, we will put into action our own future-oriented management
practices in order to reinforce long-term growth and competitiveness.
While strategically seizing new opportunities on our home turf of Daegu
and Gyeongsangbuk-do to further solidify our position in the region,
we will proactively pursue new opportunities in areas including overseas
networks, gerontology finance, asset management, and smartphonebased
financial services. In order to further diversify our business portfolio,
we will strengthen our customer service competencies, especially in asset
management, insurance, and securities, so as to further promote synergy
among subsidiaries.
The 2013/2014 Sustainability Report published by DGB Financial Group
was compiled in accordance with international standards regarding social
responsibility (ISO 26000) and GRI G4 Guidelines, transparently disclosing
our fulfillment of the UN Global Compact¡¯s 10 Principles. The report
reflects the opinions of various stakeholders, including shareholders,
customers, local communities, partner companies, and employees.
The report contains our commitment to fulfilling our economic, social and
environmental responsibilities as a financial group, and is based on our
determination to communicate with stakeholders regarding our vision,
goals, key initiatives and activities. Going forward, we will continue to
listen to our stakeholders and make strenuous efforts to realize our vision
of sharing our dreams and prosperity with local communities. Throughout
these endeavors, I humbly ask all our stakeholders for your continued
support and encouragement.

25,DGB (The Daegu Bank Ltd),3,Korea,"Amid the tough financial environment last year, employees at
DGB Financial Group pulled together to lay the groundwork
for new growth engines by putting the values of 'workplace
and practice¡¯ at the front. We have undertaken a comprehensive
restructuring of our mainstay affiliate Daegu Bank while
enhancing marketing campaign that targeted corporates
relocating to Innovation City, raising customer loyalty and
consumer base. With Shanghai branch, opening Ho Chi Minh
office have allowed us to provide differentiated and convenient
financial services to our customers based in the region.
We are the first local financial holding company to enter into
insurance industry by establishing DGB Life Insurance, which
contributed to diversifying growth engines and creating
synergy. Meanwhile, DGB Capital has expanded its branch
network and asset management portfolio while U-Payment
has achieved a remarkable development as it grew electronic
payment business and introduced nation-wide transportation
card system. DGB Data System has expanded the joint
project of the integrated IT operation of affiliated companies.
Daegu Credit Information has upgraded affiliates¡¯ services
and streamlined organizational structure, thereby greatly
contributing to the increase in the group-wide synergy.
With those efforts, we demonstrated a robust growth with
total assets reaching KRW 41.0097 trillion, up 9.13% from the
previous year, and net income recording KRW 243.8 billion.
The Group won the President¡¯s Prize in the ¡®Sustainable Management¡¯
category at Korea National Quality Award in 2014
for the first time in Korea. We saw our reputation as an excellent
business for sustainable management further solidified
in 2014: the Group was included in DJSI Asia-Pacific/Korea for
fifth and sixth consecutive years respectively. We were also the
only business in the domestic financial sector to be selected
as the ¡®Excellent Performer in Corporate Governance 2014.¡¯
DGB Financial Group has set the management goal for 2015
as ¡®Substantial Takeoff¡¯. We seek to rise as the ¡®best partner for
future¡¯. To achieve this goal, the Group devoted to implement
the following principles to pursue sustainable growth of the
group as well as the local communities.
First, we will achieve ¡®smart growth¡¯. The Group will continue
to diversify its business areas and to create new sources of
profits. Not only an appropriate rate of growth but a qualitative
improvement will be secured through a proactive risk
management and profit boost of our core business.
Second, we pledge to maximize management efficiency. To
that end, the Group commits to unleashing its changing and
innovating DNA while overhauling the cost structure through
organizational restructuring. The key goals of each affiliate
shall be clearly recognized and shared among the members
involved, and a detailed strategy shall be set up to achieve
such goals.
Last, we will reinforce synergy among the Group members.
DGB Life Insurance, launched as the sixth subsidiary of DGB
Financial Group, will allow the Group to take the synergy level
to the next level. In addition, in order to turn barriers we face
as a latecomer into opportunities we will invest a significant
amount of time and energy creating synergy among existing
affiliates including banking and capital business to strengthen
sales outcome. We also pledge to inspire our brand-new
life insurance business to boost synergy with the rest of the
Group.
The year 2015 marks a meaningful milestone for DGB Financial
Group. 10 years ago, the Group promulgated its
corporate vision, goal, and strategy for sustainable growth at
the ¡®Sustainability Management Declaration Ceremony¡¯. The
Group also demonstrated its commitment to sustainability
management as it joined the UN Global Compact and signed
the United Nations Environment Program Financial Initiative
(UNEP FI). DGB Financial Group will take stock of the sustainability
management system to date in order to identify correctional
issues, thereby expediting the win-win growth with
stakeholders.
Going forward, DGB Financial Group¡¯s overarching corporate
goal is ¡®Sharing Dreams for Richer Life with Local Communities¡¯.
To that end, we pledge to take heed to stakeholders¡¯
valued inputs and keep being inspired by sustainable management
that is ever relevant to the communities we serve.
Your unwavering support and interest would be greatly appreciated.

509,DGB (The Daegu Bank Ltd),4,Korea,"In the face of a challenging business environment with ongoing low-growth and low-interest trends, everyone at DGB Financial Group has made a sincere effort to lay the foundation to become a regionally-based total financial group. The Group¡¯s flagship subsidiary, DGB Daegu Bank, became the first regional bank to launch a mobile banking service, ¡°iM Bank¡±, and Loan Center as a preemptive response to the new FinTech era, and made significant progress in its national branch network-building plan with the opening of a branch office in Gyeonggi-do. In its first year of incorporation, DGB Life achieved significant performance results with enhanced profitability on the back of increased sales of protection-type insurance while significantly improving its marketing brand image. Guided by a new mid-term vision, DGB Capital launched an Auto Loan service, aggressively expanding its business portfolio. In this way, all of our subsidiaries played a strong role in contributing to group synergy over the past year.
These efforts earned us wide recognition through external awards and listings. To name a few, DGB Financial Group was listed on the 2015 Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Asia-Pacific and DJSI Korea for the sixth and seventh straight years, respectively; It became the first and only Korean bank to become one of the 2015 East Asia¡¯s CSR Top 30; and it was named the leading group of the financial sector in mitigating climate change by the 2015 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Korea. Our financial performance also improved over the previous year, with a 0.61 percent return on assets (ROA) and an 8.85 percent return on equity (ROE), while total assets surged by 39.1 percent over the previous year to reach KRW 57.1 trillion in 2015. This was thanks to the purchase of DGB Life. The Group earned a total of KRW 294.1 billion in net income for 2015.
Looking ahead to the new year, DGB Financial Group set the management goal for 2016 of ¡°Practical, Substantial and Competitive Finance¡± and will put into action three tasks; reinforcing group competitiveness, expanding new business lines, and enhancing synergy and management efficiency.
First, we will devote ourselves to reinforcing the Group¡¯s competitiveness. To that end, we will efficiently select where to concentrate our corporate resources to support the strengths of each subsidiary while developing new sources of income to enhance our competitiveness. At the same time, we will support aggressive marketing campaigns by our non-bank subsidiaries to raise national recognition of the DGB brand, while continuing systematic risk management practices to enhance asset quality and to achieve qualitative growth and fundamental reform.
Second, we will secure growth engines by expanding into new lines of business. While increasing our business domains in the non-banking sector, we will optimize our business portfolio to build up our global competencies by creating global expansion plans for the mid-to long-term. We will also develop new business models that utilize advanced technologies, such as FinTech, and increase the number of branch-in-branch offices in order to swiftly adapt to the new market trends of the financial sector.
Finally, we will concentrate on enhancing synergies and management efficiency through close communication and group-wide collaboration. Based on a shared sense of unity under the single overarching roof of DGB, we will strive to heighten the sense of belonging and pride among members of the Group while expanding our base of mutual understanding and collaboration. We will also develop various cross-selling products between and among the bank, insurance and capital subsidiaries to take advantage of Group synergy. With the top priority on reinforcing the competencies of individual subsidiaries, we will concentrate on improving productivity and eliminating losses in the work process through active group-wide sharing of personnel management and other corporate resources.
The year 2016 will be the starting year of taking our decade of endeavors towards sustainability management to the next phase. Humbly looking back on our past accomplishments, DGB Financial Group will fill our shortcomings and revamp our systems to make further progress in our sustainability management efforts in the coming years as a leader in sustainability management practices.
Going forward, DGB Financial Group will continue embracing change and challenge ourselves to become a regionally-based total financial group while giving back the trust and support we have received from our stakeholders. We will listen to our stakeholders and put our sustainability management plans into practice. Throughout these endeavors, I ask for your continued support and encouragement.

28,Doosan Engineering &Construction,2,Korea,"We are committed to creating a better future for our stakeholders.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your unwavering trust
in and support for Doosan E&C. I am very pleased to share our CSR
activities and performances in the economic, environmental, and
social aspects with you, stakeholders through the publication of our
first sustainability report.
The global economic recession and the slow recovery of the domestic
real estate market over the years have resulted in adverse business
environment for the construction industry. Despite these difficulties,
Doosan E&C is making multifaceted efforts to create new growth
engines and will continue to grow. In particular, we have been
diversifying our business portfolio through the acquisition of Doosan
Mecatec and the HRSG business.
Stakeholders are looking at companies from a different point of view.
Their perspectives are expanding into CSR areas that require social
responsibilities in various sectors such as the environment and shared
growth beyond a focus on financial matters.
Doosan devised group-wide CSR strategies to proactively respond
to these changes. Based on these strategies, Doosan E&C also newly
established its unique three CSR philosophies of ¡®Responsible
Engagement, Developing People, and Reliable Operating¡¯. We will
share our CSR activities and performances in accordance with these
philosophies with all stakeholders.
First, we will conduct CSR activities centered on people.
Under the Doosan Group¡¯s philosophy of 'People are the Future',
we will focus on cultivating talents who will lead our society. To this
end, we will devise HRD strategies meeting the characteristics of
individuals, provide opportunities to grow through works, and build an
organizational culture that every employee can act and communicate
by the fair rule. On top of that, we will contribute to the development
of next generations and local communities to grow together.
Second, Doosan E&C will further fulfill the Doosan Way and social
responsibility to gain more trust.
We are committed to ensuring the safety of society and neighboring
people by building stronger internal EHS (Environment, Health,
and Safety) standards than international standards. In addition, we
will dedicate to secure differentiated technologies and innovate
ourselves to supply superior products and services surpassing
customer expectations. These activities will solidify our fundamental
competitiveness in the long-term perspective.
Third, we will reflect material issues identified from stakeholder
engagement in our decision-making process.
I think stakeholder engagement is a prerequisite for a company to
fulfill corporate social responsibility. We will continue to enhance our
sustainability by expanding communication channels to listen to
various opinions of stakeholders and proactively responding to them.
Doosan E&C will emphasize change and innovation and make a
concerted effort to achieve its vision of ¡®Becoming a Leader in CSR

29,Doosan Engineering &Construction,3,Korea,"Doosan E&C has published its second CSR report after the first one being published last year. I am very pleased to share our CSR activities,
performances and future plans in the economic, social and environmental aspects with our stakeholders through this report.
The business environments recovered slowly due to the smooth recovery of the global economy and the government¡¯s economy-invigorating
policy, but it is still difficult to expect a stable growth because of increased uncertainties and intense competition between companies.
Therefore, we will achieve sustainable growth by improving our competitiveness in the existing construction business area and exploring new
growth engine.
In order to establish the foundation for the new century under the vision of ¡®Infra Solutions Provider That Makes the World a Better Place¡¯,
Doosan E&C is striving to strengthen the fundamental competitiveness, while also fulfilling its corporate social responsibilities.
First, we will create future value by developing people.
We believe that human resources have been our strength during the past half-century, as well as the strongest competitiveness for continued
success for the next century. Based on the Doosan Way, we established an organizational culture where every employee can act and
communicate according to fair rules. In addition to, we will establish a virtuous cycle to cultivate talent which will lead our future.
Second, we will strengthen future competitiveness through reliable operating, such as reinforcing fundamental
competitiveness and risk management.
In order to achieve medium and long-term growth, it is important to secure fundamental competitiveness through differentiated technologies
and acquire the ability to respond to uncertainties and risks. Doosan E&C will continue reliable operating by managing financial and nonfinancial
risks through quality improvement and technology development, as well as shared growth with suppliers and stronger EHS
(Environment, Health, and Safety) standards.
Third, we will enhance the future competitiveness of local communities through responsible engagement.
We will contribute to the society by achieving sustainable growth based on strong business ethics. By aiming for the mission of ¡®Enhancing
Future Competitiveness of Communities and Corporate Value through Strategic Social Contribution Activities¡¯, we will develop social
contribution programs and increase employee participation and talent donation from the long-term perspective of the business concept.
Doosan E&C will make concerted efforts on change and innovation to achieve its goal of ¡®Becoming a Leader in CSR in the World by 2020¡¯.

30,Doosan Heavy Industries &Construction,1,Korea,"At Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction, we have been engaged in a wide range of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities over the years. This
integrated report is our first to combine financial reporting previously provided by our annual report with sustainability reporting from our CSR activities
covering seven areas, including governance, human rights, labor, the environment, fair business, customers, and local communities.
The year 2012 was a particularly meaningful year for us. As we marked our 50th anniversary, we also unveiled the ¡°Doosan Way¡±, the philosophy and culture
that drive us to be a leading innovator of products and services that improve the quality of life for people and communities around the world as we aspire to be
a ¡°Proud Global Doosan.¡± We strive to practice the values of the Doosan Way in both business and our daily lives.
Grounded in our people-centric philosophy of corporate growth through personal growth, we are now implementing a variety of employee welfare and benefit
programs to promote work-life balance. We are running capability-building programs based on our job capability development roadmap to foster professionals
in each business field as well as the next generation of leaders. In addition to prohibiting discrimination based on gender, race, education, or age, we are
expanding hiring of women, local staff, high school graduates, interns, and disabled persons. We are also building on seven consecutive years of strike-free
collective bargaining and a commitment to shared growth to foster a forward-looking labor-management culture.
In 2012, we continued to achieve sustainable growth, surpassing revenues of KRW 10 trillion despite the ongoing global economic downturn. This performance
is the culmination of our ongoing efforts to enhance our global top-tier quality products and technical competitiveness as well as growing synergy with our
global subsidiaries achieved through the optimization of our global operations. It is also a result of our active involvement in stakeholder-based CSR activities
aimed specifically at sustainable growth.
As part of our commitment to social responsibility, we are working to secure world-class transparency in governance as we practice ethical management. We
are building innovative win-win relationships with our suppliers through financial and technical assistance as we strive to foster true partnerships. We are
striving to create a healthy and pleasant environment by reducing greenhouse gases and managing pollutants. We are also actively involved in a broad range
of initiatives to fulfill our commitment to corporate citizenship. In addition to establishing a CSR fund, we are supporting the education of tomorrow's engineers
and scientists, children and youth from disadvantaged families, and migrant women as well as conducting community service and free medical clinics. We are
also committed to making a difference around the world through medical, educational, and environmental initiatives in Vietnam, India, and other countries.
In 2013, we plan to establish a corporate-wide CSR committee tasked with systematically carrying out our CSR initiatives. The committee will be composed of
five sub-committees focusing on human resources, ethical management, shared growth, environment, health, and safety (EHS), and community, each of which
will be responsible for formulating, reviewing, and implementing CSR projects in their specific areas.
Thank you again for your interest in and support of Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction. We are committed to actively communicating our CSR activities

31,Doosan Heavy Industries &Construction,2,Korea,"Doosan Infracore is concentrated on the strengthening of its underlying competitiveness to become
a sustainable enterprise. The company upholds these values with its motto: ¡®Building your tomorrow
today¡¯. The company provides its customers with products and services that have drastically improved
the areas of quality, features and costs. Doosan Infracore is committed to providing the best
products and services in the world by not only trying to see things from the customer¡¯s perspectives
to make innovations in its technologies and products but also changing the way it works and cultivating
Doosan people with professional competency.
Doosan Infracore has achieved significant outcomes by focusing on the enhancement of
underlying competitiveness.
The year 2013 was a year Doosan Infracore poured companywide capabilities into strengthening its
underlying competitiveness. In the business environment, the economic recession continued worldwide
- as it did in 2012 - with competition among companies in the industry becoming even more
competitive and the construction machinery market, the company¡¯s key business area, did not show
any sign of recovery.
However, even in such environments, the company was able to maintain the profit level of the previous
year as a result of all the company employees around the world striving to enhance the company¡¯s
underlying competitiveness. Sales dropped slightly to KRW 7.7368 trillion in 2013 as slowdown
lasted in most markets except in North America while operating profit increased more than in 2012
to KRW 369.5 billion due to Bobcat¡¯s upswing and the company¡¯s efforts to strengthen its cost competitiveness.
It further enhanced its financial soundness by improving its cash flow and successfully
raising USD400 million via GDR sales.
On top of that, the company made impressive progress in quality, technologies and productivity, as
well as making improvements in its business portfolio. In particular, Doosan Infracore achieved prominent
improvement in quality through the operation of quality innovation TFTs in Korea and China.
In addition the company also boosts the emotional quality as well as the technological quality of its
products through a newly built integrated design center. By launching Bobcat compact equipment
equipped with a compact diesel engine that it developed on its own, the company reinforced the
foundation for growth in North America. The completion of a plant devoted to the production of large
machine tools in terms of the company¡¯s enhancement of its high-end product portfolio was a huge
success.
Doosan Infracore will maximize the performance of the existing business
while discovering new growth engines.
In 2014, the economic recovery that started in the second half of 2013 will continue, yet economic
growth will remain weak. The United States and Europe are expected to achieve gradual recovery
whereas China and emerging economies will continue to have sluggish growth rates.
Doosan Infracore will maximize its performance in the existing business areas on the basis of its enhanced
underlying competitiveness in preparation for full-fledged recovery periods down the road. In
the meantime, Doosan Infracore will strive to discover its additional new growth engines in the midto
longterm. To this end, Doosan Infracore will implement the following specific strategies in 2014:First, the company will double its efforts to increase profits and enhance its financial stability.
Throughout its entire value chain including technologies, purchase and quality, the company will reduce
material costs and quality assurance costs while maximizing profit creation into new markets as
well as focus upon the expansion of sales in highly lucrative items. The company will cope with exchange
fluctuations efficiently and continue the financial innovation activities that it started in 2012.
Secondly, the company will concentrate on the development of technologies and products with competitive
market advantages along with quality innovations. It will convert its quality innovation activities
including quality innovation TFT into a permanent system, strengthen input from its customers¡¯
perspectives regarding product quality, and expand the scope of its quality management to include
its service and suppliers. The company will successfully launch new products that meet the new
emission standards and embark on the development of a lineup of high value-added products while
continuing to strive to secure technologies that will differentiate its mileage and functions from its
competitors¡¯.
Thirdly, the company will expand its customer contact points. It will be active in fostering prominent
dealers in key emerging markets while promoting dealer restrictions and normalization to strengthen
its channel competitiveness. Additionally, the company will upgrade its dealer education and improve
parts supply rates with a purpose of making remarkable improvements in its service response time
and service quality, thereby improving its level of customer satisfaction.
Lastly, the company will never neglect to find future engines of growth. Currently, the company is
engaged in the task of finding mid to long term growth themes by its teams of strategists established
in its Corporate Center. The company will carry out diverse attempts to integrate information
technologies into mechanical industry while continuing to seek opportunities to expand into relevant
businesses such as machinery for the mining industry and 3D printing.
Doosan Infracore will implement the Doosan Way and its corporate responsibilities
to become a proud global enterprise.
Doosan Infracore will continue to promote its motto: ¡°The Doosan Way¡± in 2014 with a focus placed
on ¡®Doosan Way Change Model¡¯ based on the cultivation of Doosan people, the achievement of advanced
scientific systems and processes, and enhancement of underlying competitiveness. We will
set up a job competency system and step up our professional education to cultivate proud Doosan
people armed with job expertise, and continue to promote enhancement of quality, technologies and
services, and development of new models, to strengthen our underlying competitiveness. Together
with the companywide nine core process improvement activities, the company will carry out the
CORE Office activities more actively and eliminate inefficiency in its work processes.
The company will spare no efforts to become a respected enterprise by fulfilling its social responsibilities
as a global corporate citizen. It will promote shared growth with its suppliers around the
world through practical win-win cooperation programs, and grow together with future generations
and local communities through strategic CSR initiatives. Furthermore, the company will work harder
for its employees¡¯ safety and health, and do its utmost to protect and care for the global environment
through operations that promote eco-friendly measures. On top of that, it will respect the basic
principles in its endeavors to protect its employees¡¯ health and safety and enhance the integrity of
the global environment by operating eco-friendly business sites, developing environmentally-friendly
products, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in all of its work processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,Doosan Heavy Industries &Construction,3,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders,
I would like to sincerely thank you all for the support you have shown
our company, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction.
As a company that specializes in power plants, our company
possesses world-class expertise in the fields of power and water,
all of which are applied to raise the value of Earth. Additionally, in
order to ensure that the future generation lives a sustainable life, we
are endeavouring to further develop advanced technologies and
businesses and fulfill our social responsibilities as a corporate citizen,
thereby expanding our presence as a global company.
Despite the global economic downturn in 2013, Doosan Heavy
Industries & Construction still managed to win contracts for highly
significant projects like the Nghi Son 2 coal-fired thermal power
plant project in Vietnam worth KRW 1.8 trillion and the Karabatan
combined cycle power plant project in Kazakhstan. We also achieved
meaningful results by signing contracts to supply key equipment to
the Shin-Kori Nuclear Power Plant Units 5 and 6 and Hwaseong
Dongtan District 2 Community Energy System. By expanding our
competitiveness in both domestic and overseas markets, we have
brightened the outlook for 2015. In addition, we conducted national
projects for the development of a large gas turbine, while bolstering
our position in Korea¡¯s 1,000MW USC (ultra-supercritical) market,
receiving recognition for the strengthening of our fundamental
competitiveness and efforts to acquire future growth engines.
In addition, we took a major leap forward in terms of our corporate
social responsibilities. The effective operation of the CSR Committee,
which is composed of five subcommittees (Human Resources,
Ethics Management, Shared Growth, EHS and Community)
reinforced the policies and systems relating to human rights and
the supply chain. The upgrading of the EHS system helped to
further improve our employees¡¯ health and safety and conserve the
environment. Meanwhile, we reorganised the systems to enhance
the future competitiveness of local communities and held events like
the Doosan Day of Community Service. About 3,000 employees
from 14 work sites in six countries around the world participated in
the event which was held on October 24, providing employees with
the chance to actively engage with the local communities.
Because of these efforts, we achieved meaningful results such as
receiving external recognition for our CSR practices, including being
incorporated in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) list, thereby
reaffirming our strong commitment to fulfill our social responsibilities.
Esteemed Stakeholders,
We expect the global business conditions to remain continuously
difficult in 2015. To acquire new growth momentum, we plan
to apply information & communications technology, as well
as implement the ESS (Energy Storage System) and energy
conversion. In particular, we will strive to develop the renewable
energy and gas-fired power plant markets. In addition, we are
strengthening our fundamental competitiveness by embedding
the Doosan Way and conducting the Team Doosan activities to
promote growth for the existing businesses, while also securing
market share and profitability for our key products, resulting in
both quantitative and qualitative growth.
As our business grows, we are striving to fulfill our social
responsibilities, while also achieving financial results. We aim to realise
a better society and pursue practical activities with our stakeholders.
This means ensuring transparency as a global company, developing
the competencies of our employees, achieving a work-life balance
and world-class safety & health, and participating in the Carbon
Disclosure Project (CDP) as part of our green business practices.
This 2014 Integrated Report covers our business results and outlook
and focuses on our goals in the area of social contribution. Doosan
Heavy Industries & Construction will strive to develop further through
effective communication with its stakeholders.
We ask for your continuous support in helping us succeed in this
notable effort. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
512,Doosan Heavy Industries &Construction,4,Korea,"Dear distinguished stakeholders,
Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction is always highly appreciative of your generous support and
encouragement.
It gives us great pleasure to be able to share with you again through our Integrated Report the changes and innovation that
we have been pursuing over the year at Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction.
Even amidst the low-growth trend that has been prolonged by the global recession, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction
has been growing to become a global corporation that adds value to the Earth by offering world-class products and technology
to our clients.
Despite the difficulties of the past year, the company was able to win orders for large-scale projects in strategic markets,
including Saudi Arabia and India, and lay the foundation for business expansion by establishing a new subsidiary, Doosan
GridTech, winning performance improvement projects for local thermal power plants and participating in national nuclear
decommissioning projects. In addition, we achieved significant business results by adopting marketing strategies tailored to
each region, which led us to successfully enter the Egyptian and Indonesian power markets.
Based on the Doosan Way, which is embedded in our work processes, our employees have helped to fulfill the social
responsibilities we hold as a corporate citizen and supported our continuous efforts to achieve sustainable growth. Human
rights management is being reinforced through town hall meetings and wider efforts are being made to promote the voluntary
practice of business ethics, while we have also sought to upgrade our preventive Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) systems
and energy efficiency systems. We also had the honor of being presented with the Grand Prize at the Korean Shared Growth
Awards ceremony, in recognition of the various supply chain support activities we were engaged in, such as the ""Shared
Growth Supporters"" work.
We have received favorable recognition both at home and abroad for our performance in sustainability management, which
includes receiving the ESG A rating from the Korea Corporate Governance Service and being listed a Dow Jones Sustainability
Index (DJSI) Korea company.
Continuing the practice of sustainable growth in the global market
Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction is pursuing sustainable growth by responding proactively and swiftly to changes
in the global power market. As part of these efforts, we launched the Service Business Group this year, through which we
are seeking to broaden our service offerings for power plants worldwide and strengthen the area of recurring businesses to
contribute to a stable business structure. Furthermore, we are continuing with efforts to expand our business by adopting
innovative technology, which harnesses the benefits of information & communications technology, such as the RMS (Remote
Monitoring Service) for power plants and Digital Factories, and we are also diversifying our business portfolio to better meet
the needs created by the tightening of environmental regulations under the new climate regime.
Faithfully fulfilling our corporate social responsibilities in alignment with the United Nations' SDGs
Built upon the reinforcement of human rights, environment, safety, supply chain and ethics management activities and the
faithful fulfillment of our social responsibilities, mostly achieved through contributions to local communities, we aim to tie
together the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the UN with our core businesses to establish and achieve the
goal of contributing to sustainable growth worldwide. We will particularly focus on effectively addressing the areas of energy,
water and climate change and make every effort to produce greater outcomes.
Moreover, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction seeks to continue the practice of sharing with local communities through
events like the Doosan Day of Community Service, a heartwarming event arranged to help the needy and which is led by social
volunteer groups composed of employees from 30 Doosan work sites around the globe.
Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction strives to continuously pursue sustainable growth this year as well and will always
endeavor to do its best in line with the company slogan, ""Winning Team,"" all the while forging ahead to realize our vision of
becoming the ""Global Leader in Power & Water.""
We kindly ask for your interest and support as we continue on our journey towards achieving sustainable business growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,Doosan Infracore,3,Korea,"It is my great honor and pleasure to meet the
stakeholders of Doosan Infracore through this
integrated report. As you are well aware, Doosan
Infracore has the longest corporate history of
any machine manufacturing company in Korea.
As a global business, it is now pursuing its
goal of becoming one of the top three machine
manufacturing companies in the world before
this decade ends. As such, I would like to take
this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude
to all of you for wholeheartedly supporting our
efforts to enhance our strong competitive edge
while continuing to achieve corporate growth
despite difficult market circumstances. With this
integrated report, we would like to look back on
our performance in 2014, discuss our plans for
the future, and assure you of our commitment
to making another leap forward.Market Situation and Accomplishments in 2014
Enhancement of Financial Stability despite Challenging Business
Environment - In 2014, the North American market recorded
continuous growth. However, the Chinese and emerging markets
showed sluggish performance which, combined with the continuing
recession in Europe and the sharp devaluation of the Japanese
Yen, posed severe difficulties to global businesses. During
the year, companywide annual sales dropped by 0.6% over the
previous year to KRW 7,688.6 billion. Nevertheless, the operating
profit increased by 22.6% over 2013 to KRW 453 billion - largely
due to the growth of Bobcat Company, the turnaround of the
Engine business unit, and the company¡¯s enhanced cost competitiveness
as a result of its ongoing drive to lower costs. Doosan
Infracore recorded KRW 24 billion in net income in 2014, and
boosted its financial stability by refinancing its Bobcat Company
acquisition loans, coupled with the early payoff of the Bobcat
Company debt to the tune of US$100 million.
Successful Launch of New Products and Enhancement of R&D Capabilities
- Bobcat Company continued to grow in North America¡¯s
compact construction equipment market in 2014, mainly due to a
sharp rise in the sales of its flagship items and the launch of its
new M Series of loaders. To meet the latest global emission regulations
and different regional requirements for equipment features,
Doosan Infracore successfully launched various competitive
products in 2014, including the new V and C models of construction
equipment, and diesel engines that meet the requirements
of the Euro 6 regulation currently being driven forward by the
European Commission. The company also completed state-of-theart
R&D centers in Korea, the USA, and the Czech Republic; and
established a global R&D network linking its existing R&D facilities
in China to these new R&D centers.
Prospects and Plans for 2015
Greater Focus to Be Placed on Improvements in Business Performance
and Strong Competitive Edge - The global economy
is expected to continue on its path of slower growth in 2015.
Under the circumstances, Doosan Infracore intends to accept
this pattern of slower economic growth as the new global economic
order for the time being, and will continue to make fundamental
reforms in its management structures so it can create
differentiated values for its stakeholders in any type of business
environment. To that end, it will spare no efforts to enhance its
strong competitive edge under the following strategies. First,
the company will concentrate on raising its competitiveness in
technologies and products to the highest level in the world,
because it firmly believes that innovative technologies and powerful
products are the main driver of corporate growth as well as
a precondition for it. The company will focus its companywide
resources on the enhancement of its R&D capabilities to ensure
that its employees¡¯ extraordinary passion and innovative ideas
lead to the development of the best technologies and products
in the world. Second, the company will strive to expand and diversify
its buyer base in 2015 in a drive to turn around its sales
and profits, which have stagnated over the last few years. In
addition, the company will increase the sales of its most lucrative
products such as large excavators, wheel loaders, articulated
dump trucks, top-tier machine tools and generator engines,
while further intensifying its marketing efforts for not only China
and the USA, but also for emerging markets including Southeast
Asia. Doosan Infracore will also push hard for the development
of new technologies, the discovery of new business opportunities,
and the securing of future-leading technologies and their
commercialization. Third, the company will make great strides
in its customer-centered business management by reflecting the
voices of its customers in the whole spectrum of its business
management more effectively. To become a lifetime partner for its
customers, the company will offer them innovative convergence
in its products and services, including total solutions that enable
them to concentrate on their main areas of business. Lastly, the
company will work harder to make advanced processes and systems,
accelerate its decision-making processes, and enhance its
capacity to implement its decisions. The company¡¯s employees
will try to work in a more effective and focused manner on the
basis of open communication and rational thinking, and management
decisions will continue to be made according to rules and
processes. To accelerate its decision-making speed and enhance
its implementation capabilities, the company will continue with
its organizational restructuring to enable it to respond to issues
immediately without running up against departmental barriers.
Innovations in the Way of Working and Active Fulfillment of Its
CSR - Until 2014, the company placed greater emphasis on improving
its ways of working and its corporate culture by incorporating
the Doosan Way into companywide operations. However,
as of 2015, the company will take one step further by promoting
a change in the work unit from individuals to Team Doosan to
boost its employees¡¯ work performance. According to the principles
inherent to Team Doosan, employees will be encouraged to
regard themselves as business owners and to pursue their business
goals passionately and tenaciously, while operating as a
powerful team to overcome traditional organizational inefficiency
and significantly boost their productivity. Doosan Infracore will
faithfully fulfill its social responsibilities as a global corporate
citizen. It will build a virtuous cycle of partnership with suppliers
around the world through the implementation of practical sharedgrowth
programs. It will also engage in corporate community activities
more actively to support the development of future generations
and local communities. Doosan Infracore will spare no
efforts to develop eco-friendly technologies and products while
continuing to reduce its GHG emissions to protect the environment.
The company will make great efforts to establish a safer
work environment and promote systematic employee healthcare.
Doosan Infracore is a highly resilient company. It has continued
to grow for the last 78 years, turning numerous hardships and
crises into opportunities. The entire staff of Doosan Infracore,
therefore, will never succumb to any difficulties the company
may be confronted with. Instead, they will always rise and move
forward with greater confidence in the future of the company. All
of us at Doosan Infracore will continue to treasure the Winning
Spirit that inspires us to persevere until the end and work as a
powerful Team Doosan by transcending our individual character
differences or our organizational conflicts of interest. We will do
our utmost to move closer to our vision of becoming a Global
Top 3 Machine Manufacturing Company by 2020, and to our
ultimate goal, the creation of a Proud Global Doosan. With your
trust in the earnestness of our efforts, we will definitely turn our
dream into reality. In the meantime, I look forward to your continued
interest in and support for us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the establishment of GS E&C in 1969, we are striving to provide essential value to our customers and local communities
by achieving continuous growth based a stable portfolio of plant, power, civil engineering, architecture and housing.
In 2014, GS E&C overcame many difficulties at home and abroad to establish the foundation for a turnaround, while also
restored the trust of the market by securing liquidity through paid-in capital increase and the sale of non-core assets. These
efforts have laid the foundation for a strong trust as we continued to implement sustainable management until now. GS E&C
will further strengthen sustainable management to actively respond to the rapidly changing global construction market
environment and reinforce its status in domestic and overseas markets.
GS E&C is striving to achieve shared growth with all of its stakeholders.
The forecast for this year¡¯s domestic economy is not bright, and it is expected that the business environments of high uncertainties
and fluctuations will continue due to delays and cancellations of orders in the main overseas markets like Central
America and South America. However, we will overcome the difficulties we face by integrating the competencies of our
employees and do our best to take this opportunity to take a new leap forward.
GS E&C recognizes that not only economic growth, but also environmental and social responsibilities are very important,
allowing us to continuously implement sustainable management activities relevant to our core values of ¡®Great Innovation¡¯,
¡®Great Challenge¡¯, and ¡®Great Partnership¡¯. From the environmental aspects, we strengthened leadership in carbon management

constructions through green communication activities with local communities and our suppliers. Also, in order to fulfill our
corporate social responsibilities, we are striving to establish a foundation for shared growth with our suppliers by implementing
ethical management based on stable corporate governance, as well as conducting various activities for sharing.

stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and suppliers, to actively reflect them in our business activities. To achieve

42,Hana Financial,1,Korea,"First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude
to all customers, stakeholders and members of local
communities for supporting Hana Financial Group.
In 2012, despite a shrinkage in net interest margins and
increases in bad debt expenses amid the low interest rate
throughout the financial industry, HFG has made its solid financial
performance by generating a net profit of KRW 1.6
trillion, which is a net profit of over KRW 1 trillion a year for
three consecutive years. The group has achieved incomparable
asset soundness in the financial industry in terms of risk
management and creating steady financial growth.
Above all, 2012 marked a year of making another leap forward
towards the vision of ¡°Global Top 50.¡± By incorporating
KEB and Hana Savings Bank as family members, the group has
become Korea¡¯s largest iconic financial group, and paved the
way to better fulfill social responsibilities as a corporate citizen.
To realize the vision, HFG declared a new management slogan
of ¡°Healthy Finance, Happy Together¡± by designating
¡°health and happiness¡± as core values. This is to declare that
all employees at HFG are to become ¡°healthy members of
HFG¡± both mentally and physically as they are equipped with
the top-notch ethical mindset and professionalism required
for those working in the financial industry. ¡°Healthy HFG¡±
consisting of ¡°healthy members of HFG¡± is also to become a
healthy enterprise not only in financial performance but also
in fulfilling social responsibilities. Moreover, this implies that
the group equipped to make society a place of good health
and happiness all together by standing at the forefront of
social contribution activities.
In a bid to ensure that this pledge does not end up as a mere
rhetoric, HFG formed a unit to practice the vision. The ¡°Happiness
Sharing Committee¡± consisting of CEOs of the group¡¯s
affiliates was launched to establish strategies and policies
of ¡°healthy finance,¡± approve business plans and conduct
evaluation on the agenda. Moreover, each business unit (BU)
formed an ¡°Executive Committee for Happiness Sharing¡± to
lead business initiatives on ¡°healthy finance.¡± Under each executive
committee, there are action-oriented groups in four
sectors: microcredit, financial consumer protection, support
for SMEs/youth start-ups and social contribution.
As such, the group will do its utmost to play given roles as
a healthy corporate citizen by fulfilling social responsibilities
through organic collaboration among affiliates and subsidiaries
of the group. HFG would like to seek enthusiastic participation
and support from all local community members as the
group seeks to pursue happiness and good health mutually
and collectively together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,Hana Financial,2,Korea,"Distinguished stakeholders,
First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for supporting Hana Financial Group.
As mutual prosperity of companies and the society garners a stronger attention, HFG set a new vision of ¡°The Trusted
Premier Global Financial Group¡± based on a mission of ¡°Growing Together, Sharing Happiness.¡± The new mission and
vision are HFG¡¯s commitment and promise to you to grow as a premier financial group through global competitiveness to
be united with locale all over the world. They also signify HFG¡¯s endeavors to take a pioneering approach by preemptive
perception of the changing times and their efforts to gain trust through services where customer satisfaction is the top
priority.
For HFG, 2013 was a year to lay the foundation for quantum leaps. HFG brought Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) into its
fold as a fully owned affiliate through a stock exchange. HFG now runs Korea¡¯s largest global network in the financial
sector with 128 networks in 24 countries as on May 2013. The asset value of the company is KRW 368.5 trillion, up
6% from 2012. In August 2013, HFG¡¯s network expansion crystalized in North America by acquiring Broadway National
Bank (BNB) which is the only Korean bank in the United States that has the license of a national bank as a Korean
financial company in the United States In November, HFG signed an MOU with Barclays Africa, tapping into the African
market for the first time as a Korean bank, and operating there in full swing as a global financial group.
HFG has also strived to openly communicate with customers, communities and stakeholders to attain mutual growth.
HFG has been persistent in responding to social issues on the information protection of financial consumers and
endeavoring to build up trust with customers. Setting up the Financial Consumer Protection Division for the first time
in the domestic financial sector, organizing the declaration ceremony on the Healthy Responsibilities through the Moral
Rearmament, and declaring the Charter for the Protection of Financial Consumers¡¯ Rights per affiliate are a few examples
of these initiatives. These schemes were aimed to build up customer trust with integrity. Seeking to fulfill CSR in a
financial group to a greater degree, HFG opened three additional in-house childcare centers, taking the lead in helping
women to become economically active and resolving the low birth rate problem. HFG aims to have the largest number
of in-house childcare centers in the financial sector. Moreover, the Committee for Sharing Happiness was launched in
April 2013 which helps in improving the execution capabilities of CSR measures through systematic and proactive social
contribution activities.
HFG will strive the utmost as a corporate citizen for a healthier and happier society. HFG will cheer for your happiness
and success as a genuine partner, so that customers, shareholders and communities can be united to achieve the new
vision of ¡°The Trusted Premier Global Financial Group.¡± For HFG, your continued support is greatly appreciated.

44,Hana Financial,3,Korea,"In 2014, Hana Financial Group declared a new vision of ""The Trusted Premier Global Financial Group"" based on a mission
of ""Growing Together, Sharing Happiness."" With our new mission and vision, we aim to play our part in the growth of the
nation's financial sector, growing together with our customers, shareholders, and society, actively sharing happiness. This
explains why Hana Financial Group exists and our ultimate goals for the company. Furthermore, such mission and vision are
our promises and pledges to become a top financial group for sharing greater happiness.
For HFG, 2014 was a year that marked the first step in establishing the foundation for such vision. With an integrated entity
of both Hana Bank and Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) Indonesian corporations, HFG created more synergy effect than it had
expected. HFG successfully launched an integrated entity of local corporations that gained recognition from local customers
in China. Moreover, as KEB's Card and Hana SK Card joined forces to launch ""Integrated KEB Hana Card,"" HFG has provided
customers with better goods and services. With such enhanced capacity, HFG has strived to take the lead in fulfilling its
social responsibility and promoting relations with stakeholders. With the belief that ""Education"" is an important investment
in creating a happy society, HFG targeted the key sectors of multicultural families, North Korean defectors, young people,
and global so as to provide diverse educational opportunities.
To promote constant social responsibility activities, HFG has also joined forces to operate the Committee for Sharing
Happiness and promoted systematic corporate social responsibility activities, including various projects led by the
corporation's foundation.
In response to social issues such as financial consumer protection, HFG established a financial consumer protection system
for the first time in the financial sector in Korea, which enabled the company to integrate its consumer protection-related
function and create a one-stop process. Through the system, HFG solved consumers' complaints in an accurate and prompt
manner and strengthened financial fraud prevention activities.
HFG has taken active steps to realize a creative economy: the company proposed and implemented a ""Startup Win-Win
Fund,"" which is a support model for a new type of venture company using the advantages of government, financial business
and the manufacturing industry. HFG is currently successfully operating the Fund.
Most of all, I am very proud of the fact that most of HFG's executives and employees participate in various volunteer activities
in the spirit of sincere and responsible corporate citizens.
HFG is fully committed to making strenuous efforts to become a top-class financial group that will join forces with
customers and employees, shareholders and local communities for growth and share happiness with all.
I look forward to receiving your continued interest in and support for Hana Financial Group.

46,Hankook Tire,1,Korea,"I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for your full support in our continued growth.
This past year of 2012 was particularly challenging as the tire industry experienced the toughest-ever competition
due to the fiscal crises in the U.S. and Europe, the currency depreciation policy adopted by multiple countries
and the economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets. Despite such difficult business conditions, we
set a new record in our business results: our global sales reached a record KRW 7.0291 trillion. We attribute this
achievement to the trust-based relationship that we have built over the years with wide-ranging stakeholders.
Yet, stagnancy and complacency are far from our mission, and we are undertaking strategies to grow even further.
This is clearly demonstrated through the split of Hankook Tire (a newly-created entity) from Hankook Tire Worldwide
(a holding company) in September of last year. In so doing, we have laid the basis to evolve into a major global tire
manufacturer through our enhanced specialty in the tire industry, responsible management systems and improved
business transparency.
As such, we are determined to pursue qualitative growth on the basis of the quantitative progress that has been
made over the years in order to realize our vision of becoming a ¡®Leading Global Tire Company that delivers value
and pleasure to customers¡¯. To ensure quantitative growth, we are stabilizing the operations of our new plants in
Chongqing, China and Indonesia and building new production lines. Meanwhile, we are expanding our endeavors
to create environmental and social value in addition to investments in technology, quality and services in order to
pursue qualitative growth.
Our ¡®integrated CSR management system¡¯ has been up and running across the company since 2010 to address
major issues so as to create environmental and social value. The materiality analysis enabled us to establish the
five Focus Areas of: Employee Health & Safety Management, Environmental Management, External Stakeholder
Satisfaction Management, Employee Value Creation and Transparency & Business Ethics. In each of these Focus
Areas, detailed targets, deadlines and responsible departments were defined in orderto integrate CSR initiatives into
our daily operations. Specifically, the CSR Committee was established at our China Headquater in 2012 to develop
overseas CSR operational systems in accordance with our global CSR guidelines.
Our CSR reports constitute a part of our efforts to advance sustainability management. Though our forth CSR report
where we disclosure our commitments made to stakeholders as well as our achievement, we transparently deliver
our CSR initiatives and share the value of our sustainability management.
As an entrusted corporate citizen, we will comply with UN Global Compact principles and commit ourselves to
joint growth alongside our stakeholders. As our journey continues to become a trusted company and pursue
balanced growth, your interest and support is greatly appreciated. As an entrusted corporate citizen, we will comply

47,Hankook Tire,2,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for your keen interest in and full support for our sustainable growth at Hankook Tire. With our vision to become a ¡®Leading Global Tire Company that Provides Customers with Value and Pleasure¡¯, we are committed to building trust-based relationships with our diverse spectrum of stakeholders from employees, customers and shareholders to suppliers and local communities while seeking continued growth as a company. The year 2013 was a significantly challenging year due to the slower-than-expected recovery of the U.S. and European economy and the sluggish economic growth of emerging markets. Yet, it was against such low economic growth that we made a notable achievement in the global market?we posted KRW 7.0692 trillion in sales and our operating income rose 12.2% from the previous year to KRW 1.0310 trillion. Our Hungary plant initiated the expansion of its third production line while our Chongqing plant in China and an Indonesia plant were completed to further solidify our global supply system. Moreover, we gained Original Equipment (OE) fitments for such premium automobile models as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and E-Class as well as the BMW 5 Series, which enhanced our standing as a global premium tire brand. Last year, we were listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices Asia Pacific. which measures a company¡¯s sustainability in terms of financial performance, social contribution, governance, human rights and EHS (Environment, Health and Safety). Already listed on the DJSI Korea, our new ranking on the DJSI Asia Pacific signifies that our sustained commitment to and achievement in creating environmental and social values as well as economic outcomes have been widely recognized by global professional sustainability organizations. With a goal to communicate with a broader range of stakeholders so as to identify material issues and elaborate on how we respond to such issues, this fifth CSR report primarily focuses on the following. First, we widened the scope of respondents in conducting stakeholder surveys and changed major logic to improve the process of identifying issues material to Hankook Tire and identified five Focus Areas accordingly. Second, we outlined a business process flow for our management approach to CSR issues?why a specific issue is material to us, how we manage such issues and what the outcomes are. It is based on these endeavors that we confidently present our fifth CSR report as a communication channel that offers any information that may be demanded by various stakeholders?from Hankook Tire¡¯s growth potential to its sustainability?in a transparent and accurate way. In 2014, the construction of our U.S. plant will begin as part of our continued expansion of production lines. Our integrated CSR management system will also extend its scope into our overseas operations so that localized CSR activities are undertaken at our international subsidiaries in China, Hungary and Indonesia. In so doing, we will pioneer the sustainability of the mobility industry, live by the 10 UN Global Compact principles and become a corporate citizen that fulfills its social responsibility. Once again, let me thank all our stakeholders for their full support to make Hankook Tire what it is today. Your continued support and encouragement for our journey to become a trusted company and to pursue stable growth is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

517,Hanwha Chemical,4,Korea,"To our distinguished stakeholders,
I would like to express my heart-felt gratitude to you for your unwavering interest in and encouragement
to Hanwha Chemical.
As the flagship subsidiary of Hanwha Group, a leader in the Korean chemical industry, Hanwha Chemical
excels as a corporate citizen by meeting its economic and social responsibilities, thereby adding
to its record as a leading chemical producer in Korea.
With its pioneering spirit, Hanwha Chemical has set many milestones, including the first production
of PVS and LPDE in Korea. Now, continuing in this tradition of innovation, we are opening untapped
opportunities in new chemical technologies and future-oriented businesses. These developments
promise even more sustainable, mutual growth to our stakeholders.
The year 2014 was significant for our progress in sustainability management. We altered our business
structure to boost profitability, and streamlined enterprise-wide operation systems, thereby enhancing
management efficiency and cutting costs. We also expanded the range of specialty products in
our portfolio, sharpening our competitive edge.
We have continued to strengthen our group¡¯s core values ? pioneering spirit, dedication, and integrity
? and we continue to explore new technologies and products such as high-performance PVC,
always seeking technology-driven sustainable growth. We regard our social involvement as an essential
component in our sustainability management, and toward this end, we have introduced a series
of environmentally responsible products, such as eco-friendly plasticizers.
International Polymers Co. (IPC), a joint venture with Saudi company Sipchem, has proven itself as
a high-yield business with full-fledged manufacturing capabilities and global cost competitiveness.
We also fulfilled our quest for growth drivers in the photovoltaic business, another promising area
for high growth potential. In the first half of the year, we commenced commercial production of
polysilicon, a key feedstock for photovoltaics. That step completes the vertical integration of our
photovoltaic business, from basic raw material production to end products and services. As a result of this vertical integration, our photovoltaic business achieved a turnaround in 2014, and it is now
positioned to become a world leader in the field following the 2014 merger of Hanwha SolarOne and
Hanwha Q CELLS, a flagship subsidiary.
As it implements some of the best environmental and safety protection systems in the world, Hanwha
Chemical enhances safety awareness throughout the Company, with comprehensive training
programs and systematic, thorough management. Through these efforts, Ulsan Plant achieved a sixfold
increase in accident-free man hours in 2014.
In addition, we maintain active internal communication that in turn leads to desirable workplaces
for employees. Through improvements in our communication channels during 2014, we witnessed
an increase in individual employee satisfaction levels and, thus, in the company¡¯s overall workplace
performance. We received recognition for these efforts, as well: a grand prix in the large corporation
category at the 2014 Labor-Management Cooperation Awards, sponsored by the Korea Employers
Federation.
With all of these accomplishments, however, Hanwha Chemical is not resting. We continue to sharpen
our competitiveness through active technology investment and continual inroads into global
markets. Based on our market leadership in Korea, we are emerging as a world leader from every
perspective, including humanitarian activities and eco-friendliness ? an eco-friendly company whose
businesses focus on human lives and the environment.
We look forward to your continued interest and encouragement for our sustainability management
as we create a sustainable tomorrow that enhances the value of human life.

49,Hyundai Engineering &Construction,1,Korea,"Dear stakeholders,
I am truly delighted to send you greetings through the 2013 Hyundai E&C Sustainability Report.
For the last 66 years, Hyundai E&C has grown together with Republic of Korea, leading national growth
and improving the people¡¯s quality of life. We never stopped challenging ourselves to create greater
corporate value based on our entrepreneurial spirit and firm principles.
With a strong sense of social responsibility derived from understanding the impact of our actions
on stability and happiness of the nation and the society, we are striving towards not only short-term
achievements but also long-term growth. We at Hyundai E&C will grow to become the world¡¯s best
construction company providing new value to all stakeholders.
Our roles and responsibilities as a corporate sustainability leader
Since becoming the first domestic construction company to enter the global market in 1965, Hyundai E&C¡¯s cumulative overseas
orders received recorded 10 billion USD in 1982 and 60 billion USD in 2008; in 2013, we expect to exceed 100 billion USD in
overseas orders, raising the prestige of the Korean construction industry throughout 54 countries around the world.
Our firm foundation for business activities allows us to achieve continuous growth. As a global integrated engineering company, we
lead the convergence and divergence of cutting-edge technologies in the construction industry based on close cooperation with
relevant industries. In accordance with the management principle of growing in balance of both scale and quality, we are proactively
advancing sustainability management. This year, we made particularly greater efforts to further strengthen our foundation for shared
growth with all stakeholders and developed a support system for sustainable partnerships with our business partners.
As the result of our efforts, we have solidified our global reputation for excellence in corporate sustainability by being included in
the DJSI World index for three consecutive years and being selected as the DJSI ¡®Global Supersector Leader¡¯ in the Construction &
Materials supersector in 2011.
Growing together with all stakeholders and creating a foundation
for better quality of life
Hyundai E&C strives to contribute to national development by expanding communications and interactions with more stakeholders in
pursuing sustainability management. In order to do so, all members of Hyundai E&C at 28 branches and 261 sites around the world
are pursuing activities in the five areas of sustainability management ? site safety management, minimization of environmental
impact, protection of human rights and respect for cultural diversity, support for local community development, and communication
with stakeholders - making every effort to contribute to the society¡¯s growth and happiness.
We will continue to place ¡®people¡¯ as our top priority and fulfill our corporate social responsibility for creating customer value,
endlessly challenging ourselves and inspiring innovation to make the Korean construction industry shine on a global stage.
I would appreciate your continued interest and support for Hyundai E&C¡¯s efforts to create a brighter tomorrow with customers.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,Hyundai Engineering &Construction,2,Korea,"Dear stakeholders,
We would like to express our gratitude for your concern and support that propel us to fulfill our social responsibilities.
Since our establishment in 1947, Hyundai E&C has strived to lead the national growth and enhance the quality of the
people¡¯s lives as the first Korean construction company. In addition, we do our best to promote human welfare on the
basis of the corporate culture, ¡°Human is everything¡±.
We have focused on sustainability management to actively respond to the ever-changing market of construction, and
achieve a long-term growth while we leap forward to become the global integrated engineering company. This year,
we established five areas of sustainability management to build a foundation for the shared growth of the company
and the society: management & strategy, environment, technology, employee, and society.
Hyundai E&C¡¯s sustainability managements are achieving valuable results.
For the first time in the Korean construction industry, Hyundai E&C entered the global market in 1965. In November
2013, we opened up the door for a new era of the Korean construction market by achieving the overseas orders
received of more than 100 billion USD (cumulative) and won the first place in the Construction Capability Evaluation for
five consecutive years.
Furthermore, we have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for four consecutive years and
received the first place as the world¡¯s sustainability leader in the construction sector in 2011 and 2013.
Particularly, we have been recognized as the business partner who established a successful model of win-win
partnership between a large enterprise and SMEs by providing various programs and supporting systems that
assist the suppliers to enter the global market. Moreover, we have focused on developing environment-friendly green
technologies to acquire patents and new technology certifications and are actively applying them to our sites.
We will take these outstanding performances as a stepping stone to fulfill our role and responsibility as a global
leading company in sustainability management. With a broader perspective, we will grow further together. Please look
forward to Hyundai E&C¡¯s promising future which fosters a better tomorrow and a bigger happiness. I kindly ask our
companions¡¯ and our stakeholders¡¯ love and interest.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,Hyundai Engineering &Construction,3,Korea,"Last year, even with intensified competition and emerging market risks as well as falling oil prices in foreign
markets, Hyundai E&C¡¯s corporate sustainability management has clinched a most valuable accomplishment.
Since entered the foreign market for the first among Korean construction companies in 1965, we established
a new record of USD 100 billion in overseas orders received (cumulative) in November 2013. Moreover,
Hyundai E&C is leading the Korean construction wave winning overseas orders worth more than USD 10
billion annually for 5 consecutive years up to the year 2014. Beside these financial performances, Hyundai E&C
is currently concentrating all of its capability for sustainability management activities such as the transparent
management, environment-friendly business operation, and win-win management with suppliers, together
with an active social contribution thus stabilizing our position as a global company.
Hyundai E&C is the first construction company to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)
for 5 consecutive years as well as has been selected as the world¡¯s sustainability leader in the construction sector
in the years 2011, 2013, and 2014. I believe this achievement is a recognition that our innovative and future-oriented
performances are most outstanding among global construction companies in aspects of the commitment to the
society and sustainability. We should also take note that the Engineering News-Records (ENR), a worldwide renowned
Engineering & Construction magazine, has rated Hyundai E&C as the 13th on ¡®The Top International Contractors 2014¡¯
based on its overseas sales. Hyundai E&C is expected to enter the 10th ranking in the years to come.
Improvement of Business Environment and Innovation of Corporate Culture
The main business focus of Hyundai E&C this year is our company¡¯s ¡®improvement of the business environment¡¯ and
¡®innovation of the corporate culture.¡¯ For a stable and sustainable growth, the improvement of business environment
should precede. Our goal is to diversify our business environment as well as to advance our business management
system through the expansion of the value chain by stepping further beyond the form of EPC business. In order to
overcome the current crisis, Hyundai E&C seeks its own identity and DNA differentiated from other companies. With
solidarity and a challenging spirit in our hearts, Hyundai E&C, as a future-oriented company, will continuously pioneer
the business market by responding to changes and searching for solutions.
Since being incorporated into Hyundai Motor Group in the year 2011, Hyundai E&C has constantly been evolving. In
the aspect of managerial strategy, we have focused on the profitability and liquidity rather than the turnover as well as
on the diversification of markets and work types. In addition, Hyundai E&C has established a new management system
to enable a distributed risk management thus thoroughly prepared to respond to changes. A continued interest and
encouragement on the process of Hyundai E&C¡¯s change and innovation would be most appreciated.
Hyundai E&C will continuously carry out its duty and responsibility of being a leading global sustainable company.
As a business partner, furthermore, we will continuously develop and execute various programs that assist our
suppliers to expand to overseas markets. Hence, Hyundai E&C will establish a successful model of a win-win
management between large corporations and medium and small corporations.
As companions of Hyundai E&C, your constant support and encouragement are always appreciated.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
520,Hyundai Engineering &Construction,4,Korea,"am more than willing to express our deepest gratitude to all of you who have shown immense support and encouragement for Hyundai
E&C to advance into the global construction leader. In 1947, Hyundai E&C became the first construction company that brightened
the first light of the Korean construction industry. Since then, we have advanced along with the national history and persistently expanded
the scope of our business areas covering from the establishment of the country's infrastructure to the cutting-edge, future environmentfriendly
construction.
Fruits of Sustainability Management
Despite of the prolonged economic stagnation of the domestic and global construction industry, Hyundai E&C has attained outstanding
accomplishments by its stable profit-driven management proving the status and power as the global construction leader. Since our first
overseas advancement in 1965, we have been writing a new history of the global construction for the past 50 years with our records
that are new and unprecedented. Following an achievement in 2013 that the accumulated amount of overseas orders received reached
USD 100 billion, Hyundai E&C won overseas orders worth USD 10 billion in 2014 again for three consecutive years. As of May 2016,
furthermore, we are the first domestic construction company that succeeded to attain the accumulated amount of overseas orders
of USD 120.7 billion recording total 818 overseas orders cumulative. Hyundai E&C is also striving to acquire advancements in the quality
aspect; we are continuing to solidify our status in core markets such as the Middle East and Asia without being settled for the past
outcomes. On the other hand, in addition, we focus our efforts on penetrating into new markets including Central and South America,
sub-Saharan Africa, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) regions.
Hyundai E&C pursues not merely the economic performance but the ""Sustainability Management"" as the core corporate values. Hence,
diverse corporate capabilities have been concentrated on realizing values of the sustainability management such as the transparent
ethical management, environment-friendly business operation, shared growth with suppliers, and fulfillment of social responsibility.
Besides, it is thanks to the devotion of each member of Hyundai E&C to be included in the DJSI (Dow Jones Sustainability Index)
for six consecutive years as well as to be selected as the Industry Leader of the global construction industry for three consecutive years
from 2013 to 2015.
Stability Management and Innovation of Corporate Culture
The focal point of Hyundai E&C for 2016 is the 'Stability Management' and 'Innovation of Corporate Culture.' It has been said that it
has reached the limit for the construction market to achieve a qualitative growth due to the weakened market environment. Accordingly,
the only solution to overcome the worsening environment is further stabilizing the business through the selection and concentration and
the enhancement of technological capability. By strategically dividing global and domestic markets and thus providing products specially
customized for each market, Hyundai E&C implements a strategy of the selection and concentration advancing itself so that all sites
of Hyundai E&C can accomplish the qualitative growth. In order to promptly respond to the environment of the construction industry
that is becoming capital-intensive, moreover, Hyundai E&C will actively enter new high value-added businesses through the improved
capability in finance, investment and development, and engineering.
We will also accomplish the innovation within the organization by reestablishing the corporate culture of our own that is differentiated
from competitors. Hence, Hyundai E&C will be able to further consolidate the foothold to continuously take challenging leaps.
Please take an affectionate note of Hyundai E&C¡¯s future steps to realize changes and innovations for developing into a leader
of the global construction market.
We are more than grateful for your constant interest and support as the companions of Hyundai E&C.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,Hyundai Glovis,3,Korea,"Since its foundation in 2001, all of our staff at Hyundai Glovis have always made efforts to create a sustainable
future. As a result, Hyundai Glovis has been able to post a remarkable growth each year despite the rapidly
changing conditions in the global market. The company has maintained its reputation as a global logistics
company by selected the ¡°Forbes Asia Fabulous 50 Companies¡± for the past five consecutive years. It is believed
that this is attributable to the concerted efforts of all Hyundai Glovis staff for developing trusted relations with
stakeholders through honest communication.
Hyundai Glovis has released the latest sustainability report in order to aggressively perform its social
responsibility. By publishing this report, we will listen to you, our stakeholders, more attentively. On behalf of
Hyundai Glovis, I will do my best to build a solid trusted relationship with everyone who has invested in us. To
that end, I promise the following three points:
First, we shall achieve sustainable performance.
Businesses should continue to grow in harmony with diverse stakeholders including customers, subcontractors,
shareholders, employees, and local community. With this in mind, we will do our best to fulfill our economic,
social, and environmental responsibilities as a member of the local community and pursue sustainable
development in collaboration with stakeholders. This is publish our first sustainable management report
regarding the efforts made in that direction. We will also strive to listen to as many opinions as possible on our
sustainable management to be an exemplary global business in said area.
Second, we shall endeavor to make our very best efforts to ensure win-win growth with our
stakeholders.
A business needs to grow in tandem with the relevant industry in general to continue its stable growth
in the future. We strive to provide diverse kinds of support for our subcontractors including education on
logistics-related knowhow, management consulting, and benchmarking of exemplary cases to enhance the
competitiveness of the country¡¯s logistics industry. One of the notable things that we are doing in said area is
the provision of support for small-sized logistics businesses and their employees through the Foundation of
Korea Logistics Industry Promotion (KLIP). We will continue to step up our support for them so that they can
build global competitiveness and contribute to the development of the country¡¯s logistics industry.
Third, we shall establish and instill a healthy, transparent ethical management culture.
Nowadays, emphasis is placed on the need for sound and transparent business ethics as indispensable
conditions for businesses¡¯ sustainable growth. We at Hyundai Glovis make it a rule for all employees to sign
the Ethics Oath and hold ceremonies like declaring the Code of Ethics and observing Ethics Day in an effort
to have an ethical business culture take root among employees. We also strive to expand such efforts to our
subcontractors with the aim of fostering an atmosphere of ethical management in the entire logistics industry.
We sincerely hope to open a new page of sustainable future with our stakeholders to lay the solid basis for
long-term growth. We look forward to your countinuous support as we fulfill such objective.

53,Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd,3,Korea,"Dear Valued Customers, Shareholders, and Investors,
Employees of HHI, Partners, Communities, and all Stakeholders:
It is my great pleasure to present our second report on our activities
and performances for sustainable growth.
The 2015 HHI Integrated Report combines the annual report and
the sustainability report in response to stakeholders' demand for
information disclosure. Through this report, we hope to provide
more systematic and detailed account of HHI¡¯s management
philosophy, future plans, value creation processes, and value
outcomes.
The year 2014 was an eventful year for us. We were ranked in
the ""Global 500"" compiled by Fortune magazine for the eighth
consecutive year. In addition, we earned recognition and credit
for our technology as a global leading company by successfully
developing the LNG-FSRU (LNG Floating, Storage & Regasification
Unit). Nonetheless, we were unable to avoid a significant drop
in sales and heavy operating losses due to the prolonged global
recession, the downturn in shipping industry, and the closing in of
competitors such as China and Japan.
Thus, we declared 2015 as ""a year of reform for a competitive
recovery,"" and promoted radical changes and innovations including
business restructuring and divisional consolidation.
We integrated the Offshore & Engineering Division and the
Industrial Plant & Engineering Division to maximize our efficiency.
We are also consolidating our overseas branches and affiliates
based on their profitability. Likewise, we initiated a group sales unit
by consolidating the sales organization of our three shipbuilding
entities. We also launched the Group Shipbuilding A/S Center to
deliver better service. Additionally, we merged similar tasks in the
fields of finance, accounting, IT, and communication to improve
management support efficiency.
We have made various efforts to reinforce our competitiveness,
such as the introduction of performance-based compensation
to encourage internal competition and the reinforcement of
responsibility management led by business representatives who
have substantial authority and responsibility for the organizations.
Moreover, we have been committed to our social responsibilities
and roles despite the difficult business environment. During
2014, we invested KRW 330 billion in initiatives and measures
aimed at raising safety awareness among employees and at
establishing a safer work environment. We also reached out to
socially marginalized neighbors in the communities by carrying out
philanthropic activities such as raising funds through the ¡°Charitable
Bazaar with Love¡± and the ¡°Making Kimchi with Love¡± event.
Guided by our conviction that our competitiveness depends on our
subcontractors¡¯ competitiveness, we support a variety of shared
growth programs for subcontractors¡¯ sales growth and overseas
expansion. We established our own sustainable management
models such as business ethics and compliance management,
complying with international norms and opening transparent
management information.
Based on close communication with stakeholders, we will
continuously endeavor to be a more reliable company. We would
greatly appreciate your attention in our voyage toward becoming
the best. Finally, we look forward to your unwavering interest and
support for HHI¡¯s sustainable future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,Hyundai Motor Company,1,Korea,"First, I would like to thank everyone who had given their support to helping make it another
successful year for the Hyundai Motor Company.
In 2012, Hyundai Motor continued to grow despite the global economic recession. We sold over
4.41 million vehicles in 2012, which was an 8.6% increase from 2011. We also completed the
construction of a third manufacturing plant in Beijing and a new manufacturing plant in Brazil,
securing the capacity required to enable strong market penetration and dominance in two of
the largest emerging markets. The added capacity expanded Hyundai¡¯s overseas production
capacity to 2.5 million units, which is approximately 56.7% of Hyundai vehicles sold in 2012.
Thanks to the growing network of diversified production capacity, Hyundai¡¯s capacity to
respond to changing customer demands in different regions is now stronger than ever.
We plan to focus on achieving ¡®Innovation of brand image through strong quality management¡¯
in 2013. We are well aware that a high quality product and cutting edge technology are the
key sources of Hyundai¡¯s competitiveness and will therefore invest our resources to further
enhance these strengths.
We will continue to pay close attention to our customers¡¯ opinions and will reflect these in
our products and services, while maintaining our leadership position in quality and advanced
technologies. We will also continue to deliver the most satisfying customer experience at all
points of contact. The development of green vehicles is now a top priority for the Hyundai
Motor Company. We will increase our competitiveness in green vehicle technology by stepping
up our investment in electronic control technologies and by recruiting and nurturing the best
employees. We will continue to invest to build upon Hyundai Motor¡¯s capacity for growth and to
create more jobs.We will also strengthen our partnerships, via stronger collaboration and better communication,
with our business partners such as suppliers and sales dealers to ensure business growth for
everyone.
Hyundai Motor believes that business management is much more than simply creating profit
through the manufacture and sale of products and then sharing it with our stakeholders. We
believe that the true essence of business management is about the creation of positive benefits
for society throughout the value chain. In fact, generating positive social benefits in addition to
creating a healthy flow of profit through its business activities is the ultimate goal of Hyundai
Motor. This objective is deeply rooted in the corporate philosophy of the Hyundai Motor
Company and I am confident that we on the path to achieving it.
This sustainability report is a key channel of communication between Hyundai Motor and
our stakeholders. I hope you find the information about Hyundai¡¯s recent achievements and
management philosophy useful and look forward to continuing this dialogue in the future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,Hyundai Motor Company,2,Korea,"First, I would like to thank everyone who has given their strong support for sustainable growth and made 2013 yet another successful year for
the Hyundai Motor Company.
Hyundai aims to realize the dream of humanity by realizing a brighter future with creativity and unyielding spirit of challenge.
We have been publishing a sustainability report which captures our business, environmental and social contribution activities guided by our
management philosophy. I sincerely wish this report to serve as an effective channel of communication with our stakeholders.
Hyundai¡¯s ultimate goal is creating an automobile which is not just a means of transport but a lifetime partner with much greater significance.
In this light, we are striving to apply the most innovative green technologies available in order to provide new services that make life more
enjoyable and convenient.
The global automotive market is growing ever more competitive. Faced with increasing uncertainty with automotive technologies evolving
with an infusion of new technologies, Hyundai Motor is focusing its capacity on developing innovative new products and technologies for the
future market. Currently, fuel efficiency and safety performance improvement occupies our highest development priority.
We will make the utmost effort to develop the most advanced technologies necessary to make green and smart cars available on the market.
As of February 2013, Hyundai Motor began mass production of a fuel cell electric vehicle, the Tucson ix FCEV, in Ulsan, making Hyundai the
first company in the world to do so.
The Tucson ix FCEV can travel up to 594 km on a single charge which is on par with conventional vehicles equipped with an internal
combustion engine. Thanks to the technological progress we have made, Hyundai Motor was selected as supplier of FCEVs for the European
Union¡¯s demonstration program.
Beginning in 2013, the Tucson ix FCEV will be made available to select regional government offices and public institutions in Korea. In 2014,
FCEVs will be made commercially available to regular consumers in the US.
FCEVs are superior in environmental performance emitting nothing but water. It is truly a vehicle of the future and a product of future
technology. We will firmly establish our leadership by delivering more green vehicles and developing advanced technologies and nextgeneration
FCEV systems.
Hybrid electric vehicles are also an important technology for Hyundai. We released the Avante LPi hybrid which is the first hybrid electric
vehicle that runs on LPG in Korea. The Sonata hybrid was released in 2011 in Korea and the US. Most recently, the Grandeur hybrid was
released at the end of 2013, expanding Hyundai¡¯s lineup to the large vehicle segment. We are committed to satisfying customer demand for
greener automobiles by further expanding hybrid electric vehicles in Hyundai¡¯s lineup.
Hyundai is also endeavoring to carry out social contribution activities that contribute to creating greater shared value which will no doubt
help us maintain our credibility and respect as a corporate citizen. We intend to create and share new value by providing high quality services
beyond customer¡¯s expectation.
We will continue to work with global partners in developing new technologies and achieving the highest quality in our products, paving the
way for win-win growth. In addition, we collaborate with our business partners to strengthen social contribution activities in areas including
traffic safety, environmental protection, social welfare, education support and so on, in the communities in which they operate.
Hyundai Motor is committed to continue its growth by ensuring solid business performance and sharing environmental and social values
created with our customers. I look forward to your continued support and engagement in the future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,Hyundai Motor Company,3,Korea,"In 2014, a year marked by a global economic downturn,
Hyundai Motor Company (¡°Hyundai¡±) sold 4.96 million vehicles
worldwide, 4.9% more than in the year before. We believe
the increase is a direct result of producing more diverse ecofriendly
cars and introducing more models adapted to local
market characteristics, which has raised our brand recognition.
In addition to anticipating the demands of global markets and
consumers, our efforts to enhance the brand value of Hyundai
will continue toward the goal of being the world¡¯s best in
product quality.
The future automobile that Hyundai pursues is more than
superior mobility; it is a ¡°lifetime partner¡± that delivers the
mobility of the highest possible efficiency and thus makes
life more worthwhile and rewarding. In addition to automobile
business, we will do our utmost to communicate with our
stakeholders and address such social issues as natural
resources, environmental protection, and traffic safety. Based
on these goals, we direct all of our business activities toward
creating shared value.
In product development, we have spared neither efforts nor
resources to make Hyundai vehicles safer for both drivers and
pedestrians. The new Genesis, launched in 2014, has become
the world¡¯s first to achieve perfect scores in all categories of
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash test,
known for its highest standards in the world. Inspired by such
a hard-won feat, we will firmly fix our R&D focus on being the
world¡¯s best in automotive safety. We are also working hard
to lead the development of autonomous driving technology,
one of the most talked-about topics in the automotive world,
as the technology is sure to raise auto safety to a whole new
level. To play a leading role in popularizing the next generation
of smart cars, we are undertaking R&D with a focus on mass
production. In fact, some of our latest models are already
equipped with an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS),
a technology that can bring fully self-driving vehicles closer to
reality.In addition, Hyundai has established its ¡®2020 strategy for ecofriendly
vehicles¡¯ as part of its contribution to the creation of
sustainable society. Through continuous R&D over the past
20 years, we have created diverse eco-friendly systems and
succeeded in producing parts crucial to clean mobility. We have
proved our eco-friendly vehicle technology with the launch
of Tucson FCEV, the world¡¯s first fuel cell electric vehicle
successfully mass-produced. We plan to apply this innovative
technology across our line-up, including electric and hybrid
vehicles. We also plan to improve the fuel efficiency of our
conventional internal combustion vehicles by 25% by 2020.
How these resolves will shape our future competitiveness
depends on how we attract and nurture superior human
resources. We will therefore expand R&D investments,
increase cutting-edge research facilities, secure more
talented engineers and strengthen our industry-academia
collaborations.
Corporate citizenship has a prominent role in creating
shared value. Based on our philosophy of win-win, we have
established three key strategies of growing with our suppliers,
forging stronger ties. We are also active in supporting and
cooperating with various global communities in the areas
of technology, education, arts and culture, in the hope of
creating the future value.
With our new thinking and new action, we will strive to
create environmental and social values based on economic
performances, and share them with our customers. We look
forward to your continued encouragement.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
523,Hyundai Motor Company,4,Korea,"Hyundai Motor Company (¡°Hyundai¡±) is dedicated to bringing
aspirations of our societies to reality based on ¡®unlimited sense of
responsibility¡¯, ¡®respect for mankind¡¯ and ¡®realization of possibilities¡¯?
the cornerstones of our management. In terms of vision, Hyundai
aims to become a ¡®Lifetime partner in automobiles and beyond¡¯
by producing not a mere means of transportation but vehicles of
optimum mobility that make people¡¯s lives more convenient and
pleasant. Pursuing this vision in 2015, we sold 4.96 million units
worldwide, continuing the growth trend that has been unbroken
since 1998 for 17 consecutive years. Such a feat would have been
impossible without the unwavering support and encouragement of
our customers and stakeholders, and for that I would like to express
my sincere gratitude.
In product responsibility, our goal is to achieve ¡®zero human casualty¡¯
through development of intelligent highly-safe vehicle technologies.
The Genesis G90 (locally named EQ900 in Korea), introduced in
2015 as the first of the luxury brand Genesis embodying ¡®Humancentered
Innovation¡¯, features such safety and convenience-focused
technologies for both drivers and pedestrians as Highway Driving
Assist (HDA) and Driver Attention Alert (DAA ) systems. Our R&D
focus will stay human-centered, firmly fixed on developing Advanced
Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and other innovative technologies
that contribute to the safety and convenience of customers. In
addition, by proactively expanding car connectivity technologies
and services, we will provide solutions to individual preferences for
lifestyles available in the new era.
In conducting social responsibilities, Hyundai is working on creating
shared value (CSV) beyond the realm of economic activities to
address social issues through a variety of programs, including startup
support programs, launched at home and abroad, which have
contributed to lessening unemployment among younger generations
as well as to making the auto industry of respective countries more
competitive. Also introduced are activities demonstrating Hyundai¡¯s
technological prowess and commitment to its social responsibility,
such as a recreational attraction, a health program and an invention,
all to bring joy and happiness to customers and community members:
a kids race track, called the ¡®Cha*-Car-Cha-Car Playground¡¯, where
even sight-impaired children can experience driving; the ¡®Health
Care Project for Taxi Drivers¡¯; and wearable robotics for walking
assistanceOverseas are our social activities as extensive as our global presence,
focusing on health, technology, education and cultural issues. In the
U.S., we support children¡¯s tumor research and treatment through
the Hyundai Hope on Wheels program; in Europe, provide solutions
to youth unemployment problems through the Skills for the Future;
and in India, help farmers attain economic independence through our
Dream Village project.
In the environmental aspect, we are making progress in minimizing
environmental impacts of automobiles by improving the efficiency of
the powertrain and developing alternative fuel vehicles. Namely, in
2016 we developed the world¡¯s first dedicated vehicle platform that
supports three distinct powertrain systems?electric, hybrid and
plug-in hybrid?thereby successfully launching an IONI Q line-up.
Lastly, Hyundai works to facilitate communication with its
stakeholders. In 2015 we held a series of management-customers
sessions at which we explained our product development philosophy
and steps taken toward enhancing customer value, listening to their
opinions and answering their questions. We also set up the Corporate
Governance & Communication Committee, exclusively consisted of
outside directors and dedicated to the protection of shareholder
and investor rights, and sought to reflect market opinions in the
making of major business decisions. In working with suppliers, we are
refining the three win-win growth strategies developed on the basis
of Hyundai¡¯s co-prosperity philosophy. In addition, Hyundai Motor
Manufacturing Czech, Hyundai Motor Brazil and Hyundai Motor India
were named outstanding business in the areas of personnel and
labor-management, testaments to our efforts of solidifying trust
between labor and management. We will continue our efforts at
meeting stakeholder expectations on all our business sites.
2016 is expected to be another challenging year for the world
automobile market; and Hyundai and its 110,000 global employees
will make proactive responses to market changes and work to their
best ability toward enhancing value for, and growing together
with customers and other stakeholders. We hope this report will
remain a communication medium of disseminating messages of our
sustainability.

57,Hyundai Steel,1,Korea,"It is my great pleasure to share Hyundai Steel¡¯s sixth Sustainability Report with our
Stakeholders
In 2012, both domestic and global economies lost much of their vigor in the wake of
the financial crisis in Europe and the United States. The steel industry also remained
in the doldrums due to the deepening global oversupply and sluggish demand for
steel in the construction and shipbuilding industries.
In the face of these challenging business conditions, Hyundai Steel adopted a profitfocused
emergency strategy and progressed with the construction of its third blast
furnace according to schedule, which is considered as a new growth engine. As a
result, we posted KRW14,128.7 billion in sales, KRW870.8 billion in operating
profit and KRW791.4 billion in net income. Total production volume exceeded 16
million tons for two consecutive years; production volume in 2012 stood at 16.04
million tons, including 8.91 million tons of flat steel products and 7.13 million tons of
long products. As seen from this figure, high value-added products represented a big
share in production with flat steel accounting for as much as 55.6%. This achievement
is the result of our determination and efforts to overcome the global economic slump
and achieve sustained growth.
The year 2013 marks the meaningful 60th anniversary of Hyundai Steel. Since its
establishment in 1953 as Korea¡¯s first steelmaker, Hyundai Steel has ceaselessly
challenged itself with innovation to move beyond domestic boundaries and emerge
as a globally competitive steel company.Our integrated steel mill in Dangjin is also slated for completion this year. Through
the acquisition of Dangjin Works in 2004, construction of the first blast furnace on
January 5, 2010 and the second furnace on November 23 of the same year, our long
journey will finally come to a fruitful end when the construction of the third blast
furnace is completed in September 2013. I am very happy to share this proud history
with our stakeholders.
Hyundai Steel endeavors to build a clean and transparent corporate culture and
maintain a fair trade order. We implemented a fair trade voluntary compliance
program (CP) in 2002 in order to promote fair trade practices and compliance with
the fair trade law and the subcontracting law. In an effort to proactively prevent risks
arising from the violation of the fair trade law and to facilitate a fair trade culture
within the organization, we ensure that all employees sign a pledge of compliance
which commits each to fair trade and we use experts in the field of fair trade to teach
our employees. As a leading global steelmaker, Hyundai Steel promises to do its
utmost to commit itself to ethical management and fair trade practices.
Hyundai Motor Group and its affiliates, Hyundai Steel, endeavors to leave a better
environment to our future generations by establishing the world¡¯s first resource
circulation business structure that has a minimal impact on the environment. Steel
sheets made from such resources as iron ore are supplied by Hyundai Steel to
Hyundai-Kia Motors to make automobiles. When automobiles reach the end of their
life cycle, Hyundai Steel utilizes the steel scraps to produce long products used in
building structures.The eco-friendly resource circulation business structure is the key to the green
management policy of Hyundai Motor Group and Hyundai Steel, being at the center
of this value chain, aspires to emerge as the world¡¯s best eco-friendly steelmaker.
Hyundai Steel will lead the way in making a clean world where the natural world and
humanity live in harmony.
Dear stakeholders,
Mutual benefit and cooperation are values that must be put before anything else for
sustainable growth of a corporation. We hope to be a partner of our stakeholders in
the journey toward our vision of ¡°leading a new era of steel.¡± All of us at Hyundai
Steel will do our best to fulfill our corporate social responsibilities and create a warmhearted
world. I kindly ask for your unwavering support for Hyundai Steel so that
our efforts can bear good fruit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,Hyundai Steel,2,Korea,"Hyundai Steel entered 2014 on a positive note. Since its foundation in 1953 as Korea¡¯s
first steelmaker, Hyundai Steel has made ceaseless innovation efforts and taken on
challenges to grow beyond boundaries and become a globally competitive steelmaker.
These endeavors culminated with the completion of the third blast furnace and our
merger of the cold rolled plate business sector of Hyundai Hysco, completing an
integrated steelmaking line-up that encompasses everything from molten iron and hot
rolled plates to cold rolled plates. This varied product line-up, which is based on blast
furnaces and electric arc furnaces that churn out a combined 24 million tons of steel
products annually, will serve as a stepping stone for Hyundai Steel to grow into a leading
global steelmaker. At the same time, we will make every effort to strengthen the company
and proactively take on any challenges in the internal and external business environments.
To begin, we are pursuing sound growth. Keenly aware that a company with strong
fundamentals can survive difficult times, we are going back to basics to reinforce our core
competencies, especially in safety, marketing, production and procurement. In addition
to aggressive investment and innovation initiatives in safety management practices that
encompass safety awareness, systems and procedures, every employee will strive to
achieve accident-free worksites on the way to making us one of the safest workplaces in
the world. Furthermore, as we review our quality and service practices from customers¡¯
perspective, we will continue to listen to every customer through active communication
with them in developing new products. We strongly believe that these efforts will take
Hyundai Steel to the next stage of its development.Second, we are determined to establish a system that can preemptively respond to
changes. By putting candid communication at the top of our priority list for embracing
market differences, we will develop creative ideas to optimize the corporate organization
so as to timely read any changes in the market and swiftly embrace them. In a bid to
harness the synergies arising from our acquisition of the new cold rolled plate business
unit, we will work hard for the harmonious integration of human resources and corporate
culture. This will enable us to maximize the operational efficiency of all integrated
steelmaking operations and lay the groundwork for us to become a leader in the global
steelmaking industry.
Finally, we will remain vigilant to our sustainability management endeavors through all
these business activities. At Hyundai Steel, we believe that our tireless efforts towards
harmony and cooperation are the basis of sustainability management efforts. As such,
we maintain close communication ties with all stakeholder groups and pursue mutual
growth along with them through win-win partnerships and various other collaboration
efforts. Specifically, we have never wavered in our win-win partnership programs with
SME suppliers even amid the challenging business environment, while also adding further
programs. Another value we will remain focused on is establishing transparent and fair
transaction practices within the industry through our compliance program (CP) as well as
our continued commitment to business ethics and compliance with fair transactionsHyundai Steel is the world¡¯s first company that has realized a resource circulation
business value chain for its green management practices. We were also the first steel
company in the world to complete an eco-friendly enclosed raw material process system.
Furthermore, we have individual departments in charge of environmental management
at each of our worksites to develop environmental management plans, monitor environmental
facilities, check up on our compliance of environmental regulations, and ensure
the development of related technologies. On top of that, we are involved in a number of
social contribution activities and community engagement programs in fulfilling our social
responsibilities. In the future, we will continue to maintain a close relationship with local
residents.
Looking back on the past decade, Hyundai Steel has been through a great many
changes. That said, we have never wavered in our vision. I would like to deliver my deepest
appreciation to all of our stakeholders for their support in our company and humbly ask
for your continued encouragement.

59,Hyundai Steel,3,Korea,"It is a pleasure for me to present Hyundai Steel¡¯s sustainability management activities in an
effort to become a world-leading company. Over the past half century, Hyundai Steel has led
the development of technologies related to the electric arc furnace and has contributed to the
economic development of Korea. In 2010, we completed the construction of integrated steelworks
and grew into a global steel company with the best product portfolio in the world.
Amid the growing uncertainty of the global economy and the prolonged complications caused by an
excess supply of steel, Hyundai Steel has focused on devising measures to turn the current crisis into
an opportunity and to strengthen its competitiveness. In addition to its merger with Hyundai Hysco¡¯s
cold-rolled business unit in 2014, we established Hyundai Special Steel as our afliated company,
after acquiring a special steel company that produces wire rod products. We also launched Suncheon
Forging Plant after taking over a company that manufactures forged products in 2015. Through the
merger with Hyundai Hysco, we were able to expand our business to encompass steel pipes, an
overseas Steel Service Center, and lightweight auto parts. We have now grown to and become a
global integrated steel company with assets worth KRW 31,000 billion, achieving a remarkable
growth in the past few years.We will become a leader in the new era of steel.
Hyundai Steel set the year 2015 as the rst year for surging forward

second decade of the century sustainable steelmaker. With the vision
of ¡®Engineering the Future beyond Steel¡¯, we aim to provide new values
beyond the expectations of our customers by supplying optimized
materials to make products according to customers¡¯ visions, based on
the best technology and quality.
We will make every effort to build a safe working environment.

working environments. Hyundai Steel aims to create the its¡¯ safety
workplace that lives up to its global reputation by increasing investment
in the safety management of human resources and in the enhancement
of safety facilities, by completely reforming the safety management
system, and by laying down a culture of safety management.
We will practice eco-friendly green management.
Hyundai Steel has attained the position of a clean steelworks by
becoming the rst in the global steelmaking industry to introduce a fullyenclosed
raw material processing system, including dome-type raw
materials storage buildings. In 2014, we conducted regular company-wide
environmental inspections to pre-emptively respond to environmental
risks. In addition, we minimized our impact on the environment throughout
the entire process starting from the manufacturing process to finished
products, in a bid to establish a healthy company.
We will grow and share with the society.
We pursue the road of mutual growth based on win-win cooperation.
Support for small and medium-sized suppliers in difcult conditions is
provided especially in a bid to contribute to a balanced growth of the
economy. In order to build a society filled with warmth based on the
principle of sharing, we will conduct various CSR activities and establish
a strong bond with local communities.
Hyundai Steel will continue to be at the forefront of the steelmaking
industry and will strive to be a global steelmaker respected by the
society. We will also share the love and support that we have received
from our customers, with the society, and play our role as a sound
corporate citizen that creates new social values. I humbly ask for your

524,Hyundai Steel,4,Korea,"
Dear our stakeholders, It is my great pleasure to present Hyundai Steel's performance prior to a step toward another 100 years of its history. The 2016 Hyundai Steel Integrated Report is not only a footprint of our previous efforts for better future, but also a promise for our new vision, 'Engineering the Future beyond Steel'.

In 2015, the world economy went through a severe recession and many global steel companies had to experience economic breakdown and restructuring despite every nation's great efforts to stimulate the world economy. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is continuing this year, as companies in China and Europe are still undergoing restructuring and reorganizing. In order to strive through this situation, Hyundai Steel began cost reduction, established tailored response strategy for different customer group, and set new sales policy based on high value-added products, thereby increasing its profitability. I believe that these performances were attributed to our employees' passion and challenging spirit and to your continuous support.

We will fulfill our role as a healthy corporate citizen who cares about the society and environment. Hyundai Steel plans to realize its social responsibility and pursue meaningful changes by communicating and collborating with its stakeholders, in order to achieve sustainable growth for more than 100 years. So, We established a vision for social contribution as ¡®Hyundai Steel Always with You', and set Value Circulation, Stakeholder Engagement, Social Innovation as core values upon considering our business capacity and social needs. We will promote social contribution activities that anyone can appreciate and participate while creating new social value of our own at the same time.

We are now in the second decade toward the Century Sustainable Steelmaker. The past ten years were the time of glory for Hyundai Steel as it made the impossible possible. We proudly completed building the integrated system for steel business and climbed up as a global steel company by acquiring Dongbu Special Steel and SPP Yulchon Energy, followed by the merger with Hyundai Hysco. In last July, we announced a new vision, 'Engineering the Future beyond Steel' in order to build the basis for our sustainability. The new vision reflects our corporate identity that led the national key industries for 60 years and our determination to lead better future through differentiated value creation along with stakeholders including clients, partners, and local community. Hyundai Steel, upon its great success in the past 10 years, will begin the next decade to become the Century Sustainable Steelmaker.

Dear stakeholders, This Integrated Report covers both financial performance reported in the Annual Report and non-financial performance reported in the Sustainability Report, including our value creation process based on our midand long-term growth strategy. We will continue our challenge to become a leader in the steel industry alongside you. And I believe that your support will be a great help to our future.

I sincerely ask you for more encouragement and patronage to Hyundai Steel. Thank you.

We will create new value for our sustainable growth.

The steel industry throughout the world is facing many obstacles in business. Also, the constant changes in business environment make it difficult for companies to make any predictions, thereby enforcing more thorough preparation and hard work. Hyundai Steel, therefore, set this year as the basis for achieving its vision and sustainable growth under the management policy, 'Creating Shared Value for a New Leap Forward'. Moreover, we are creating new values and sound organization, which will be the foundation for our competence, through the three strategies: 'differentiated product value', 'organizational operation in compliance with principle' and 'noble corporate culture'.

60,IBK,1,Korea,"Dear customers, shareholders, government agencies, and citizens:
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our stakeholders for continuously supporting and encouraging IBK through their unwavering love and affection.
The year 2012 was a difficult one in terms of economic conditions worldwide, due mainly to the financial crisis in the Euro zone and delayed economic recovery in the US. The ripple effect wielded influences on our economy; thus, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and ordinary people went through huge ordeals.
Doing its best for SMEs¡¯ development and delivering warmhearted banking to ordinary people, IBK provided KRW 100 trillion in loans for SMEs for the first time ever in the financial sector amid the difficult economic situation. The number of its retail customers also passed the 1 million mark for the second consecutive year. Through the bridgeheads we secured for overseas penetration for future growth engines, all our employees cemented the fundamental framework of sustainability management while enhancing competitiveness harmoniously.
We at IBK strive to lead an economic virtuous circle, sharing our accomplishments with society. We wish to make banking and financing customer-friendlier and easier to access by reorganizing the interest rate system for their easy understanding and by reducing the maximum lending rate to one digit. We also declared year 2013 as the Innovative Year for Financial Consumer Protection, established the Financial Consumer Protection Center, and vowed to put the highest priority on consumer protection and customer happiness.
SMEs are the very basis of IBK¡¯s foundation. We willingly assist in SMEs¡¯ management in various ways including financial support for win-win growth with SMEs, which account for about 99% of Korean businesses. Through IBK consulting to help SMEs and middle standing companies take off as world-class companies, IBK presents comprehensive solutions in various sectors including management, accounting, tax affairs, legal affairs, and environmental management. To deal with the manpower shortage of SMEs and youth problem, we have been operating Job World, a free employment portal specializing in SMEs, since 2009. We actually provide various social contribution services engaging stakeholders, based on the spirit of sharing and consideration. In particular, Truly Good Meal Service Vehicle of Love for the underprivileged in communities and Truly Good Nature Sharing to experience nature in national parks are earning raves. With various education/training services including financial and economic education and free customer satisfaction (CS) education, we have disseminated the talent contribution culture in and outside IBK. In particular, we offer many financial products and services support projects so that actual financial benefits can be distributed to the alienated class. In recognition of all these efforts, IBK earned the most excellent grade among 16 banks in the performance evaluation of financial support for ordinary people conducted by the Financial Supervisory Service in 2012.
IBK pledges to become a bank for sharing and consideration ? and which can give actual help to SMEs and socially underprivileged class ? through ethical and right path management by complying with domestic and international laws and regulations and IBK¡¯s code of ethics and through internal stability management that places the highest value on customer happiness. We will make all-out efforts to become the world¡¯s top-notch bank that fulfills its social responsibilities as truly required by citizens, while abiding by global standards such as the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and CDP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,Kangwon Land,1,Korea,"Distinguished stakeholders,
We sincerely thank you for supporting Kangwon Land with undying love
and attention.
Thanks to your support, we went smoothly for two years after inauguration.
Through the fourth Sustainability Report, we would like to report the
overall results of our management so far. Everyone working in Kangwon
Land is always striving for new challenges for sustainable growth despite
negative factors such as the global recession. Korea¡¯s slow growth conditions
are facing a long term and fast changing economic environment
both domestically and overseas. We successfully hosted an FIS Assembly
in 2012 to provide the basis for conventional businesses and through this,
we have actively started to pursue the MICE industry and achieved noticeable
results after two years. Practical management policies characterized
by innovation and internal stability and devoted efforts of managers and
employees have resulted in being selected as the leading corporation in
the Asia-Pacific region for two consecutive years in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Indices (DJSI). Our competency is being recognized throughout
the world. Now, Kangwon Land is about to take its second leap forward for
higher and bigger value creation based on our results together with all of
our interested parties!
We shall carry out our duties and
responsibilities as a socially responsible corporation!
Kangwon Land was established for the purpose of economic vitalization
for abandoned mine regions in in the Southern Gangwon Province in the
Republic of Korea. Our reputation as a successful sustainable local development
establishment is outstanding as we create economic values by
creating a large scale integrated resort and establish an efficient management
system, while also expanding social value sharing. Furthermore, we
are also striving to reduce the social side effects that come with the industry
through various systemic complementary efforts, prevention activities
through campaigns and active rehabilitation activities that enables community
participation through High1 Bakery and others. We are especially
complying in advance with related laws and government policies as well
as leading a fair business process to establish a transparent corporate
culture among others in order to carry out our duties and responsibilities
as a public organization.
Our objective is to establish sustainable growth
by the new growth engines.
Kangwon Land¡¯s sustainable growth paradigm is based on establishing
a wholesome leisure culture and integrated resort for four seasons. For
this, we are actively pursuing the creation of a distinguished water park
that is closely connected to existing facilities to enhance the resort¡¯s independence.
Moreover, we are also continuously expanding our conventional
infrastructure and attracting large group based customers in order to expand
domestic market shares. In particular, we are participating in various
resort businesses both directly and indirectly, such as creating tourism
clusters that connect four nearby cities and alternative businesses in
abandoned mines areas to greatly contribute in providing a foundation for
independence of abandoned mines regions and economic independence
for the areas.
We put value sharing into practice through customer
inspiration and efforts for mutual cooperation!
We are leaders when it comes to creating value for our customers with
the most sincere and best possible services with the mindset that puts
customers first and foremost. We are communicating in real time with
our customers through SNS and doing our best to become the best resort
where customers can enjoy themselves comfortably with efforts such as
reinforcing systematic service activities that provide suitable responses
according to business Divisions. We are also responding to various contents
and convenience facilities by expanding parking areas, outdoor
performance venues, nature friendly trekking courses, improving resort
scenery among others. Moreover, we want to share the value of mutual
growth with our neighbors. Consequently, we regularly discuss local community¡¯s
economic, social, cultural issues with abandoned mine regions
representatives/communities in the center in order to reinforce our social
role to provide fundamental solutions. We especially maintain a close
cooperative relationship with residential companies where local residents
and abandoned mines¡¯ laborers have invested and established themselves
to create more work and support our partner companies to become a social
enterprise.
We create a Green Resort where people
and nature can rest together!
Kangwon Land is responding in advance to various environmental issues
such as global warming, environment regulations and others. We seek
sustainable growth through environment friendly economic activities that
take nature and environment effects into account first and foremost. We
have strived to create a Green Resort where human society and nature can
coexist by minimizing harmful environmental effects within the resort and
conserve the uncontaminated natural environment of the Baekdu mountain
range. These efforts have been widely recognized and we were selected
as the best environment friendly golf resort in 2012. We are planning
to do our best to become a top class Green Resort and provide happiness
to people and nature by constantly pursuing company-wide environment
friendly management.
We would like to sincerely thank everyone who showed interest and provided
love and attention that contributed to the making of Kangwon Land
as it is today. We are constantly reminding ourselves that your sincere encouragement
and support is the energy behind sustainable growth. We
would like to thank and request your unchanging trust and support.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

525,Kangwon Land,4,Korea,"Dear Respectable Stakeholders,
I am very pleased to have this opportunity of greeting our stakeholders through our seventh sustainability report.
Since Kangwon Land was founded in June 1998 based on the Special Act on the Assistance to the Development of Abandoned
Mine-neighboring Areas, we have been striving to revitalize the abandoned mine areas. We are contributing to the economic
growth of the abandoned mine areas through the payment of the Abandoned Mine Areas Development Fund and direct and
indirect investments. We are also dedicating to the improvement of the quality of life for both local residents and public citizens
based on various social contribution activities. In addition, we are leading activities to solve the addiction problem of various forms
including gambling addiction and their side effects while operating the only domestic casino in Korea.
2016 was the year that Kangwon Land renewed our integrity and transparency based on new organizational culture by eliminating the
cronyism culture which was the source of corrupt practices in the organization. In particular, as the result of proactive building anticorruption
and integrity ecosystem and promoting our integrity policy across the organization, Kangwon Land has been selected as the
Excellent Organization for the two consecutive years in the Anti-Corruption Initiative Assessment, hosted by the Korea Anti-Corruption
& Civil Rights Commission. In addition, we are continuing our position as a sustainable global company by being included in the Dow
Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World Index, ranked by S&P Dow Jones, the world¡¯s leading financial information company, for the
fourth consecutive years. Kangwon Land will continue to be revitalized as a model public corporation that earns the public trust through
strengthening compliance and responsible management and implementing sound management activities.To become a sustainable enterprise, we are making a distinctive ¡®Highland Healing Resort¡¯.
Kangwon Land is strengthening our corporate capabilities to prepare the foundation of sustainability upon the expiration of the
Special Act on the Assistance to the Development of Abandoned Mine-neighboring Areas in 2025. With the goal of creating the
best ¡®Highland Healing Resort¡¯, we are strengthening our competitiveness as a global resort complex by developing unique resort
contents and improving our services. In particular, we are striving to differentiate our resort from other resort complexes by
focusing on improving the facilities that are best suited to the natural environment which is the primary advantage of Kangwon
Land. The Water Park facilities designed in accordance with the natural and climatic conditions of Gangwon Province are currently
under construction, and the resort is transforming into a place where leisure and relaxation coexist by providing cultural and artistic
spaces where exhibitions and performances are held throughout the resort. Along with this, we are providing various kinds of
sightseeing and entertainment to our customers by strengthening healing contents that are harmonized with the nature such as
Book Caf?, trekking with forest road, and healing spaces.
We will concentrate our efforts on building global competitiveness by using ¡®Kangwon Land where I
want to visit again¡¯ as our management slogan.
Kangwon Land has been concentrating all our efforts to create a ¡®resort where I want to visit again¡¯ in order to prepare for the
intensified competition in the resort complex industry among Asian countries. Kangwon Land¡¯s new management slogan,
¡®Kangwon Land where I want to visit again¡¯, means that we secure our core competitiveness by creating distinctive resort complex
by ourselves. To this end, we are developing killer contents and focusing on making unique things to see, eat, and enjoy. In addition,
we are interested in expanding our network of similar industries, such as personal exchange with global resorts, in order to improve
the customer service mindset and the service quality. We are also paying close attention to the changes in future leisure trends
and not to fall behind the trends. This is so that we can learn from past lessons when famous resorts that had been spotlighted
failed to anticipate the future and became ¡®a place not to visit again¡¯.Along with this, in conjunction with the ¡®Creating Good Villages¡¯
project that has been promoted so far, we are striving to expand the external network to develop things to see, eat, and enjoy
when customers visit Kangwon Land. The ¡®Creating Good Villages¡¯ project, which utilizes the culture and history of the region, is
an indispensable part of creating a ¡®Kangwon Land where I want to visit again¡¯. We will make our best efforts to become a leading
resort complex that attracts domestic and international visitors by establishing tourism cluster that connects Kangwon Land to the
surrounding areas.
We will build safe and eco-friendly workplaces.
Kangwon Land, with a priority on ¡®building safe and clean workplaces¡¯, endeavors to enhance our employees¡¯ safety awareness and to
form advanced safety-oriented corporate culture. In 2016, we acquired KOSHA 18001, the first case in the resort industry, by increasing
the level of occupational safety and health activities and improving the safety and health management system. We are also practicing
eco-friendly activities and continuously promoting environmental management. We have conducted various environmental activities
including waste recycling, an increase of renewable energies, and building high-energy efficient facilities.
We will firmly establish our position as a social enterprise by revitalizing the abandoned mine areas
and contributing to the national public interest.
Kangwon Land has never forgotten its original purpose of the organizational foundation, which is to reinvigorate the local economy of
abandoned mine areas. Community-oriented social contribution activities focusing on the recovery of local communities and mutual
growth in abandoned mine areas have been promoted intensively. Also, our win-win cooperation with local suppliers has strengthened
self-sustainability of the abandoned mine areas. Furthermore, Kangwon Land is promoting sustainability activities while we aim to
increase both profitability as a public company and as a public institute. We will continue to raise CSV (Creating Shared Value) by
promoting fair and transparent public-interest management and demonstrating synergy to generate profits as a company. We will
do our best to enhance the national status of Korea and revitalize the local economy as we proactively support the Pyeongchang
2018 Winter Olympics to be held in Gangwon Province. I look forward to the continued interest and encouragement from all our
stakeholders.
Thank you very much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,KB Financial Group,1,Korea,"With endless thanks to the clients, shareholders and community
members that have shown KB Financial Group continued
support, it is my great pleasure to greet you and present our
second Group-wide Corporate Sustainability Report.
In 2012, the Korean economy was not immune from the global
economic slow-down caused by economic difficulties in both
the developed and emerging markets. The financial industry also
faced one of its most difficult management periods in history.
However, this was also a period in which KB Financial Group¡¯s
management and employees demonstrated their passion and
drive to overcome difficulties and grow despite macro-economic
trends. Starting with the merger of KB Savings Bank in January,
achieving the milestone of 5 million Smart Banking users,
winning the city treasury contract, launching KB Kookmin Bank
China, and renewing its role as manager of the National Housing
Fund this past April, we at KB Financial Group worked together
to strengthen and diversify our business portfolio and develop
new drivers for future growth.
In addition, we strengthened corporate governance by enhancing
managerial transparency and board independence, and improved
policy instruments and processes to embed more stringent
business ethics and compliance by introducing an Ethics Mileage
program and Ethical Management Advisory ¡®Panel¡¯
We also continued to strengthen our involvement in solving
social issues linked to finance in 2012 along with our efforts
towards improving managerial efficiency. Through our key
social contribution project, ¡®Economics and Financial Education
Program,¡± we provided both online and offline courses for
roughly 50 thousand youths and members of society that have
been isolated from financial services. At the ¡°KB Good Job
Program,¡± which has come to represent private sector job creation
programs in Korea, we have hosted job fairs and provided
continuous employment data and online consultation in order
to contribute to the alleviation of the unemployment problem
plaguing our society. We also worked on our environmental
impact through planting the ¡®KB Carbon Neutral Forest¡± and
implementing energy saving activities.
As a result of these efforts, KB Financial Group¡¯s Total Assets
reached KRW 285 trillion at the close of last year, which is a
KRW 7 trillion increase over 2011. In addition, net income
reached KRW 1.7 trillion, both meaningful accomplishments
financially. Moreover, KB Financial Group was included in
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for Asia Pacific for four
consecutive years, and was recognized with over 220 awards
in 2012 including the grand prize at both the Good Corporate
Governance Awards and the Transparent Management Awards.
KB Financial Group will continue to be the Financial Group that
¡®Thinks of People First¡¯ through ceaseless change and innovation
towards achieving corporate sustainability.
2013 presents us with countless risks in the form of economic
stagnation and low interest rates but we at KB Financial Groups
will turn these risks into opportunities to pursue a new level of
growth and development.
First and foremost, KB Financial Group will strengthen its role
as market leader in its core businesses while striving to develop
new drivers for business growth and manage risks proactively to
establish a sustainable foundation for the Group. Moreover, we
will put transparent and ethical management at the core of our
business values and will work tirelessly to put this into practice
through consumer protection and prevention of financial
incidents as part of our responsibility as Korea¡¯s leading financial
group.
We will also do our utmost to fulfill our social responsibility
by building on our past contributions and deepening our
commitment to social contribution through sharing and
volunteering and we will also work to build a better future
for our society by actively working on climate change and
environmental issues.
We are hoping for your continued support in our endeavors to
do our part as a responsible corporate citizen.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,KB Financial Group,2,Korea,"I would like to express my deepest and most sincere gratitude to our customers and shareholders for supporting KB Financial Group. It is with
great pleasure that I am able to extend my greetings through the publication of the Group¡¯s third sustainability report to everyone.
First of all, I would like to sincerely apologize for the series of the financial incidents and a major breach of credit card data that have happened
recently. In order to prevent any such incidents from happening again, we will use our most best efforts to become a financial group that is trusted
by its customers and shareholders alike. This will be accomplished by overhauling the internal controls system and fortifying the information
protection management system.Along with the slowdown of the entire financial market last year, KB Financial Group also had a tough year as there was a decline in profitability
due to the low interest rate. The deterioration in financial soundness was caused by the corporate restructuring, and a series of financial incidents.
However, despite these tough times, all employees at KB Financial Group are completely committed to overcome any crisis that may occur in the
future. KB Financial Group has developed new tactics and methods on securing the satisfaction of its customers and shareholders.
As KB Kookmin Bank was selected as the custodian bank for the National Housing Fund and National Pension Service, the company has
strengthened its competitive advantage in the institutional clients market. KB Kookmin Card has also launched the K-Motion mobile card service
to carve out a dominant presence in the future payment market. KB Investment & Securities is also maintaining its leading position in the
Debt Capital Market (DCM) and the Equity Capital Market (ECM) fields, while KB Life Insurance is preparing for a new start by increasing the
sales of endowment policy products. KB Asset Management has worked hard to strengthen its key capabilities, such as leading the long-term
funds market despite the worsening financial conditions.
In particular, KB Financial Group¡¯s efforts to expand into a new business portfolio have prepared the Group for another leap forward. In March of
this year, the Group has successfully launched KB Capital, and in June, has concluded an acquisition agreement regarding LIG Insurance.
Due to these activities, the Group reported KRW 292 trillion in total assets, an increase by 6,087.1 billion from the previous year¡¯s figure. The
Group also recorded that there was KRW 1,263.7 billion in net income, which has surpassed enormous 30-million customer mark, sealing its
standing as a leading financial group in South Korea.
Even though the world economy is showing signs of recovery led by developed countries, there are still continued uncertainties, and a fast recovery
is still unlikely to happen for the domestic economy. Under such circumstances, KB Financial Group will focus on the following pledges to
make a fresh start as a solid and reliable financial group, ¡°Management Based on the Fundamentals and Principles¡±:
First, we will consolidate our capabilities in our strongest areas and build a basis for the Group¡¯s growth while remaining faithful
to the fundamentals. We will solidify our capabilities in the retail finance areas, improve the quality of corporate finances, and
enhance a competitive edge and profitability in each sector.
Secondly, we will reinforce proactive risk management. We will re-double our efforts to proactively manage assets that are potentially
at risk and manage risks of its overseas offices.
Thirdly, we will increase productivity and efficiency and prepare to creatively face growing challenges and actively develop further. We
will overhaul our programs and processes that centers on customers and plants and will fundamentally improve our cost structures.
Lastly, we will become a financial group trusted by customers, markets, and people. Just like the saying ¡°Timely Rainfall,¡± which
means rain coming with perfect timing, we will provide appropriate services when customers need them. We will become a company
that actively gives back to local communities in response to people¡¯s support and trust.
For KB Financial Group to achieve sustainable growth and contribute to creating new and continued value for customers and people, your continued
support is greatly appreciated.
Thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,KB Financial Group,4,Korea,"I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to you for your unwavering
support and encouragement for KB Financial Group as customers,
shareholders and all of stakeholders. It is a great pleasure for me to
greet you through the fifth Sustainability Report of KB Financial Group.
Looking back, 2015 was a year for KB Financial Group to pour all its energy
to be reborn as a reliable financial group for you, and strive to prepare
for its future. KB broadened the scope of financial services availability for
customers and established balanced business portfolios by embracing
KB Insurance as a new family member. Also, KB Financial Group laid the
foundation to provide new services and better values to you as a comprehensive
financial service provider by being selected as Narasarang Card
supplier and launching hybrid branches participated by banks, securities,
indemnity insurance and life insurance.
In recent times, KB has successfully completed the takeover of Hyundai
Securities, not only reinforcing its non-banking business but also solidifying
its prestige as Korea¡¯s largest comprehensive financial group. As
a consequence, all the 30,000 employees at KB Financial Group will
create a turning point for another breakthrough for KB to become No.1
through challenges and innovation.
Internal and external environments for KB are still challenging. While
uncertainties are rampant in major global economies, it is difficult to
be reassured about a clear turnaround in the domestic economy due
to the household debt burden and sluggish export. Numerous waves
of challenges will await KB. Nevertheless, KB Financial Group will never
stop taking steps for ¡°No.1 KB.¡±
In order to create the Group¡¯s synergies driven by core competitiveness
in each subsidiary and achieve ¡°No.1 KB¡± in all business areas, KB will
focus on the following initiatives.
June 2016
Chairman & CEO KB Financial Group Inc. Jong Kyoo Yoon
First, KB will lead the market as the first mover by preemptively preparing
for a newly changing financial paradigm. We will spare consistent
efforts to expand the Fintech business including settlement, security and
big data but also future growth engines of the Group including asset
management and CIB, and to ensure that each subsidiary could find its
new income source.
Second, KB will create a framework for sustainable growth by providing
comprehensive services to satisfy customers. We will initiate changes
and innovation by strengthening competencies in smart financing and
expanding synergies of hybrid branches.
Third, KB will serve as a genuine life-time financial partner for the public,
which fulfills its social responsibilities as a corporate citizen. We will do
the utmost so that happiness and hopes could sprout anywhere with
KB¡¯s presence through job creation, micro-credit services and charity
work for the underprivileged, while securely protecting and scaling up
customer assets based on the thorough ethical sense.
In order for such endeavors of KB to gain the trust of stakeholders, our
changes must be directed for the right goal. The direction of changes pursued
by KB must look towards stakeholders including customers and shareholders.
We call this path ¡°Right and Ascending Way¡± and will ask ourselves,
¡°Is our way right and ascending?¡± And we will carry on our journey toward
the ¡°Right and Ascending Way¡± with our unchanging belief.
I ask for your endless support for and interest in KB Financial Group
which strives to contribute to the value enhancement for customers and
the public through sustainable management toward the ¡°Right and Ascending
Way.¡±",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,KC Green Holdings,1,Korea,"The second ¡®Sustainability Report¡¯ highlighting our performance in 2012 is published.
In 2012, KC Green Holdings published its first sustainability report, covering the prior year 2011, to make internal assessments of corporate
social responsibilities and sustainable management as well as to determine our bearings for the future. Based on this, we are creating
an improved synergy between our traditional environmental businesses and our new green businesses, striving not only for sustainable
management, but also for social responsibility as an environmental / green industry-oriented holding company.
We achieved continuous growth despite uncertainties in the global economy.
Despite the difficult business environment due to the unstable global economy and drop in demand, KC Green Holdings and its subsidiaries
achieved improved revenue and operating profits compared to the previous year. We believe that this was possible through strategic and sound
management that utilized subsidiaries in the four fields of environmental engineering, environmental services, environmental manufacturing and
the renewable energy sector. We will continue to reach out in new markets by sharing and spreading our tangible and intangible assets among
the KC Network companies. We will also continue to explore new business opportunities responding to new demands from changing external
environments. Furthermore, we will make continuous reviews of risk factors and of sustainability by analyzing changes in the global business
environment, such as the full-fledged distribution of shale gas that has recently and actively been developed. These reviews will determine how
such changes will affect both the energy businesses in general as well as the businesses of KC Green Holdings specifically as we prepare for
the future.
A Leader in the environmental industry responding to global warming and climate change
Global warming, due to the continuous use of fossil fuels, is now changing the world¡¯s climate system. If left neglected, global warming is highly
likely to accelerate climate change and destabilize the future of Earth. The environmental engineering sector focuses on design and engineering
of systems that control atmospheric pollution from fossil fuels. Based on an increasing concern about air pollution and the future of humanity,
it is highly probable that demand for green business will grow in various sectors. To respond to such global demands for environmental
solutions, KC Green Holdings is continuously striving to develop new technologies as well as improving existing technologies. In particular,
heavy R&D investment is being made to improve the operational efficiency of existing dust collectors, FGD and De-NOx systems in terms of
CEO Message
lowering emission levels and optimizing energy consumption. This is KC¡¯s commitment to our clients as they respond to global warming and
climate changes. In addition, we are developing renewable energy businesses focusing on Photo Voltaic Power Generation alongside with
R&D for Distributed Power Generation Systems which will make it possible to use renewable energy more efficiently. The Busan-Shinho Solar
Power Generator, completed in late 2012, is the world largest PV power station (20MW) installed in a single plant. This plant showed another
environment-friendly way of construction by installing PV panels on the roofs and shades of existing buildings and storage areas.
We will continue to keep our attention focused on important energy issues in the global community.
Electric Power is an essential energy resource for industrial activities and worldwide economic growth. Many experts predict that the recent
energy shortages will be a world-wide concern in the near future and many countries are exploring economically and environmentally feasible
solutions for stable energy sources. Under the current circumstances, KC Green Holdings will pursue strategic responses to meet these
demands based on our experience and technologies for the industrial waste incineration and waste-to-energy businesses. Moreover, KC Green
Holdings will also expand beyond its RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) business to other energy supply businesses such as the use of biomass for
Combined Heat and Power (CHP).
We have set a vision and a mission for sustainable management for the balanced growth of economy,
environment and society.
In order to fulfill its corporate responsibilities, KC Green Holdings has set an objective for sustainable management, and established a new
vision with a mission to instill this vision into our management activities. To ensure that we are able to meet our objectives and produce results,
we will configure strategies to pursue and execute among our business sectors. We will set management objectives with all of our subsidiaries
and reflect those objectives into the performance indices to lead daily activities towards meeting the objectives. Internally, we will build a team
which will review sustainable management and monitor our activities and progress towards objectives. At the same time, externally, we will
develop various communication channels with our diverse stakeholders and actively listen to their opinions on sustainable management.
We ask for the participation and interest of our honored stakeholders.
KC Green Holdings, as a holding company in the green and environmental industries, aims not only at contributing to the sustainability
of humanity and the world, but also to strive to fulfill its social and ethical responsibilities. In addition, we will systematically manage the
performance of our corporate activities and share the results with our stakeholders. This second sustainability report is the outcome of such
intent, and we hope that you are happy to see this. We will make improvements where needed in the sustainability report every year and make
it a mirror in which the overall management activities of KC Green Holdings can be reflected. We would like to ask all of our stakeholders to
continue to show their interest and their support.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,KC Green Holdings,3,Korea,"KC Green Holdings strives to create and distribute maximum value for clients and
stakeholders, while ensuring a happy life to those we work with.
I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the stakeholders who showed their support for KC
Green Holdings for the past year.
The harsh business environment is continuing even in Korea and displayed long-term low-growth
amidst the global economic slowdown. The financial instability and uncertainties of the euro-zone due
to the economical crisis in southern Europe such as Greece, and the slowing growth of China had a
negative impact in the global economy, and due to this, oil prices also dropped to very low levels. This
global economic recession resulted in lower trade volumes, as well as a contraction in investments.
The environmental engineering business that supplies air pollution control systems in Korea and
abroad centering on KC Cottrell also experienced a drop in orders due to the economic recession and
low investments. Furthermore, the environmental service that engages in industrial waste treatment,
recycling and conversion into energy businesses also had difficulties due to the slowdown of the
domestic manufacturing industry. Moreover, the drop in oil prices had a negative impact on development
and investment of new renewable energies, thus, the sales environment of the solar power business
was also limited.
In result, the sales profits of KC Green Holdings dropped by about 20% compared to the previous year.
However, we are working hard to make this an opportunity for growth by overcoming the crisis with
customized strategies through market analysis and by spreading out risks.
Even amidst such circumstances, KC Green Holdings and its affiliates distributed1) 348 million dollars
in economic value to the society and stakeholders last year. We believe that through the growth of a
company, bigger values can be passed on to stakeholders such as employees, clients,
partners, and stockholders, and that it is possible to contribute to society by creating
jobs and providing job security. The goal of sustainable management pursued
by KC Green Holdings is not only of economic value for shareholders of the
company, but also social value for humanity and the world. We will continue to
do our best to repay your trust and faith",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,KCC,3,Korea,"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you.
We spent the year 2015 wrestling with uncertainty, unpredictability, and repression. However, even in this chaotic situation, KCC has fulfilled its social
responsibility with the help of its strong financial performance, technological prowess, and the efforts of all its employees. As a result, we have adopted the
ISO 26000 Sustainable Business Standard and published our first sustainability report to communicate with all our stakeholders. Our efforts were rewarded
with the Grand Prix in the Korean Readers¡¯ Choice Award (KRCA) hosted by the Korea Standard Association and the Most Loved Companies Award given
under the auspices of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.

Standard Quality Excellence Index (KS-QEI); KS Certification Prize at the 2015 World Standard Day; and our winning the Greenist Flag for our contribution to
green remodeling business development have shown our stakeholders that we are fulfilling our social responsibility and hold the best technological power.
KCC¡¯s new business goal in 2016 is the ¡°reinforcement of sales competitiveness.¡± With this, we will realize our vision of creating a better value for all by
completing our tasks as follows:
First, we will build a synergy-making system between divisions.
Now, KCC is committed to vitalizing horizontal communication between divisions, employees, and various stakeholders based on the prompt sharing of
information collected from sales activities. Furthermore, we will strengthen our sales competency and generate constant profits based on the provision of
information at the right place, at the right time.
Second, we will build KCC¡¯s competitiveness by reshaping the organization structure into a business manager (BM)?oriented one and vitalizing it.
In the BM-oriented system, KCC can have a more comprehensive view of the market than in the product manager (PM)?oriented system, which focuses only
on each relevant product group. Taking advantage of the strength of the new system, we will make a swift response to the needs of customers and the
market while cultivating capability to coordinate the production, sales, and R & D of various product groups.
Third, we will promote sustainable profit creation and growth as a global company.
To achieve growth as a global company, it is important for KCC to construct a structure where tasks and functions closely cooperate with and are organically
engaged from the level of the minimum unit. Regardless of domestic or overseas operation, KCC will see all its operations in one perspective and do its best
to make the entire company the world¡¯s best.
We are publishing our second sustainability report to listen to our stakeholders¡¯ opinions, and report on KCC¡¯s sustainable management goals and
performance transparently.
We will continue to do our best in order to settle down the sustainable management system at all levels of the company by adopting and implementing
international standards such as ISO 26000, GRI, and EICC, and to make contributions to the resolution of the various issues of stakeholders, the environment,

First, we will maintain our core value to provide stable and reliable power. With the whole nation¡¯s energy saving efforts, we can overcome the threat of power shortages. In this light, KEPCO will involve the citizens and residents of Korea in the power facility construction process and place highest priority on the safety and interests of our neighbors and communities. Second, KEPCO wil  aggressively expand into the global energy market to secure future growth engines. At present, KEPCO is carrying out 42 projects in 21 countries as of the end of 2012, and we will continue to offer a variety of energy solutions to our stakeholders and raise our global brand value based on the quality and technological expertise we possess. Third, we will take the lead in allowing easy access to clean and highly efficient energy. KEPCO plans to aggressively develop new and renewable energy sources, such as wind and photovoltaic, both domestically and abroad. KEPCO will work to improve energy infrastructure in developing countries and enhance the energy welfare of consumers to facilitate their access to energy. Moreover, KEPCO will expand the scope of smart grids and the use of advanced energy saving equipment to raise the level of efficiency in energy supply and demand. Fourth, we will realize a creative company ecosystem which is based on co-existence and communication. KEPCO will build a paradigm in which we grow together with small and medium-sized enterprises and act on our motto ¡°sharing light with the world, sharing love with the community.¡± We are also committed to sharing value with stakeholders through transparent and open management. ¡°Make the Earth a better place, make humanity happier.¡± KEPCO is determined to cultivate a quick-to-react culture of flexibility and openness which will gain us the trust of our stakeholders. We will reinforce management efficiency with creative thinking and ceaseless innovation and create new sources of income through the pursuit of R&D and overseas power projects. To this end, I kindly ask for your continued support and interest to help KEPCO leap forward as a global energy leader and contribute to building Korea¡¯s creative economy.

70,KEPCO,2,Korea,"KEPCO is striving continuously to communicate with people through energy, create current values for stakeholders, and enhance
future values through mutual growth. This report contains KEPCO¡¯s efforts and performance for sustainable energy and a better
future, as well as directions that we should follow. Last year, we carried out meaningful activities in various sectors, including sectors
for credibility and communication, enhancing company values, and sharing values and mutual growth, based on our core values
for stable electricity supply.
First, KEPCO is creating a company on trust by listening to customer opinions and communicating with people in person. We are constantly
asking ourselves the question about the essence of the electricity industry, not just depending on our reputation as an energy
company leading the 116-years of history of electricity in Korea. The answer was clear to us: without confidence, we cannot have
a future in the electricity industry. KEPCO has put in great efforts in making a company based on trust by constantly communicating
with stakeholders, including customers, local communities, and relevant institutions. We overcame the crisis in electricity supply
and demand last summer through the united efforts of the people, companies, and industries. Overcoming all crisis, the light that
lit up the seemingly endless tunnel proved to be Communication, as shown in such instance as the eight-year-long conflict over the
construction of Miryang transmission lines, which was resolved through communication with local residents. I really appreciate the
local residents who sincerely empathized with our government-led business despite the tough circumstances. KEPCO will become
the most trusted Public Company and representative energy company, listening to the voices of stakeholders based on communication
and trust, which is the foundation of the electricity industry.
Second, KEPCO is enhancing future values by strengthening overseas and new growth businesses. In 2013, we achieved an annual
overseas business sales exceeding three trillion won for the first time. Having unrivaled brand value in the overseas market, KEPCO
is leading, in the creation of jobs and national wealth by carrying out exports in different ways, such as developing and operating
power plants in the UAE, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Kazakhstan. KEPCO is currently considering the realization of a world with
¡°Sustainable Energy for All People¡±. In October last year, we held the Daegu World Energy Congress (WEC) and sought a solution
for the ¡°Energy Trilemma¡± with 7,500 participants from 123 countries, including CEOs of prominent Energy Companies and Energy
Ministers from across the world. We have held serious discussions at home and abroad on energy issues such as Climate Change
and Resource and Energy Imbalance. In response to these issues, KEPCO is preparing for a new era of creative energy. We will focus
on the improvement of efficiency in energy consumption, such as smart grids, energy-saving equipment, high voltage direct current
(HVDC), and micro-grids, and produce clean energies for future generations by continually expanding renewable energies, such as
solar and wind power.
Third, we are spreading love and happiness for all people by sharing the warm energy of hope. KEPCO is creating a warm-hearted
energy world by carrying out the ¡°Eye Love Project,¡± which helps people at home and abroad, threatened with blindness, to recover
their eyesight, and expanding energy welfare so that more people can enjoy the basic right of using energy. As well as small and
mid-sized companies (SME), social enterprises are engaged in energy conservation activities. In 2013, KEPCO held an Exhibition for
Mutual Growth in the electricity industry for the first time in Korea and supported SMEs by expanding their opportunities for entering
into the market at home and abroad, pioneering in the overseas market. KEPCO will continually promote programs for mutual growth
with SMEs until the small-but-powerful companies can stand on their own feet. Plus, we will create more jobs for the underprivileged
by carrying out the business of supporting social enterprises to help them to develop further. KEPCO will open the world of
energy with hopes of creating sustainable values together with our partners.
In November 2014, KEPCO will start a new century at Naju Innovation City beyond the headquarters at Samseong-dong, Seoul. By
moving to new headquarters, we will seek measures for realizing mutual growth with local communities and develop Naju as a New
Energy Valley. Your unceasing support will be a great boost for our great future. We will become a Public Company with a modest but
aggressive position, keeping to the middle way and encouraging innovation based on creativity. We will gather sincere hearts and
energy to create more shared values and communicate much more closely with customers. I hope that you continue to give KEPCO
your unceasing support and care. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I sincerely appreciate all our stakeholders¡¯ unceasing support for KEPCO. As a result of the continuous
communication and cooperation with all our stakeholders, KEPCO has published its 11th sustainability report
this year.
The year of 2014 was meaningful for KEPCO : we not only fulfilled the company¡¯s role and mission to achieve
the original purpose of securing stability in the supply and demand of electricity, and contributing to
development of national growth, but we also improved the financial structure with our intensive efforts and
significantly improved our enterprise value. We will start the new Bitgaram era to realize a sustainable energy
future in the electricity industry and carry out various activities as a Smart Energy Creator.
We realize a smart energy world based on communication with customers.
The global energy market has undergone changes and innovation and urged the establishment of a smart
energy infrastructure to create a sustainable energy world for all of us. To establish this next-generation energy
infrastructure, it is imperative to ensure communication with customers. We were able to secure a stable
supply and demand of electricity with our world¡¯s best quality electricity and thus have improved customer
trust. KEPCO also earned the honor of achieving the first rank of customer satisfaction for 16 consecutive years
through customized service by reflecting on-site opinions. We will enhance acceptability for power facilities
through proactive internal and external communication, shifting the paradigm in the electricity facility
construction business, and make great efforts to construct power facilities based on trust and mutual growth.
KEPCO leads sustainable growth in the future by expanding the business with new energy
sources as well as overseas business.
KEPCO has led next-generation technology such as optimizing energy through the Smart Grid, establishing an
eco-friendly energy-independent island, and demonstrating the world¡¯s largest Energy Storage System(ESS). .
We also laid the foundation for reducing GHG emissions by developing eco-friendly energy technology. As the
company established our global network in various countries such as those in the Middle East, Central and
South America, and Africa, we have achieved overseas sales of KRW 4 trillion a year. For the future, we plan
to establish a ¡®Global Energy Belt¡¯ connecting Central and North America to South America, Africa, Middle
East, and Asia to create differentiated future value and present new and better solutions for the global energy
industry.
KEPCO is creating a new future at the glocal innovation cluster, ¡®Bitgaram Energy Valley¡¯
As the company relocated its headquarters to Gwangju/Jeonnam Innovation City, KEPCO has welcomed a new
era for Bitgaram. Facing this new era, we have proactively carried out the Bitgaram Energy Valley construction
business to establish a platform in this local area to leap forward into the global market. In addition to
conducting advanced customized energy specialization business in connection with the local characteristics,
attracting energy-related companies, and making focused investment in the R&D sector, KEPCO will add value
for win-win growth with SMEs by continuously implementing industry-academy cooperation and communicating
with local communities through social contribution. Through these efforts, Bitgaram Innovation City
will become not only a new electricity capital in Korea but also an energy hub in the world.
For this new Bitgaram era, KEPCO aims to create a sustainable future with everyone under a new resolution.
We will begin a new chapter for humanity over the century by sharing today¡¯s issues with the customers who
have been supporting us in our 117-year history. We will create shared value for the future with the local community
as a partner in the electricity business, using smart energy to improve the quality of life.
I appreciate your continued support for KEPCO as we work together for a better, more eco-friendly tomorrow.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KEPCO strives to create a sustainable energy future for everyone by leading the new energy industry that
responds to the new climate change regime while fulfilling our mission to stably supply the best quality
electricity and improve the quality of our customer¡¯s lives by continuing to implement the finest electricity
business that has been in operation for the last 118 years.¡°KEPCO has become the No.1 Global Electric Utility.¡±
KEPCO was listed as the world¡¯s No.1 Electric Utility in the Forbes Global 2000 published in May,
2016 for the first time in its history. Moreover, its stock price has experienced a steady rise since
the renewal of the highest price in July 2015 and we received the highest credit rating among
global electric utilities by the world¡¯s three credit rating agencies, Moody¡¯s, S&P and Fitch. This is
incredibly important as the world not only recognises our stable electricity supply and our efficient

expansion of the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles to 3,660 chargers by 2018. Moreover,
KEPCO conducts 37 projects in 22 countries such as the Middle East, North, Central America and
Africa, which presently includes the UAE Nuclear Power Plant, and is diversifying business models
not only in the traditional areas of thermal and nuclear power but also in renewable energy and
new energy business exports. We aim to build a global KEPCO belt that connects all continents in
the mid-to-long-term through these achievements.
¡°KEPCO is creating an Energy World where values are shared by everyone.¡±
Since the KEPCO HQ changed its location to Naju in December, 2014, KEPCO has been successfully
carrying out the ¡°Bitgaram Energy Valley¡± project to turn the Gwangju Jeonnam Region into a
hub for the electric power energy industry. With an aim to attract 500 energy-related companies
by 2020, agreements for investment in the Energy Valley have been concluded with 133 companies,
as of June 2016, and we are building ¡°Bitgaram Energy Valley¡± into a coexistence role
model that shares values with local communities, for example, the expansion of localized R&D
investment through industry-university-research collaboration. Through operating an export
guarantee system for SMEs, KEPCO runs various programs for mutual growth with SMEs including
helping to locate an overseas market, enhancing joint R&D and boosting technology capabilities.
In addition, the world¡¯s first international exposition for new electric power technology,
¡®BIXPO 2015,¡¯ was successfully held last year attracting about 30,000 visitors and ¡®BIXPO 2016¡¯ is
scheduled for this November.

71,Kia Motors,1,Korea,"Despite the fast-changing business environment, Kia Motors has been realizing sustainable
shared growth with local communities in order to move beyond ¡®customer satisfaction¡¯
and offer ¡®customer value innovation¡¯. Kia shattered our own business performance highs
once again for yet another record-breaking year in 2012. Nevertheless, Kia Motors puts the
environment before business performance and continues our efforts at mutual growth with
society at large.
On the environmental front, Kia Motors actively invests in and strives to realize safe,
economical, and eco-friendly mobility in the form of hybrid, electric, and hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles. In the meantime, we launched the Green Light Project and expanded the scope of
sustainability management to do our part as a responsible corporate citizen. We continue to
strive to realize sustainable mutual growth with all our stakeholders.Customer Value Innovation
Despite the global economic slowdown, strong
Korean won, and domestic production challenges,
Kia Motors posted the highest sales revenue and
operating profit in our history. With the successful
launch of the all-new premium full-size luxury K9 (Kia
Quoris) and the compact K3 (Forte/Cerato) as well as
facelift models, including Sorento R (Sorento) and K7
(Cadenza), Kia Motors¡¯ sales rose 7% year-on-year to
2.72 million vehicles. We not only met our sales target
but we also joined the ranks of the world¡¯s top 10
automakers.
Moreover, Kia Motors¡¯ brand value grew 50% from the
previous year to 4.1 billion dollars, securing a position
among the global top 100 brands for the first time
since our founding. All this was possible thanks to
our employees¡¯ hard work and stakeholders¡¯ devotion
and support. With 2013 projected to be yet another
difficult year for the global economy, Kia Motors
will endeavor to extend win-win value to all our
stakeholders and practice sustainable management
for continued enhancement of our brand value.
Practices for Global Environmental Protection
Kia Motors is steadfast in practicing green
management despite the growing challenges in the
business environment. Reaffirming our commitment
to tackling climate change, Kia Motors¡¯ Gwangju
Plant became the first in the Korean auto industry to
receive the ISO 50001 energy management systems
certification, a comprehensive standard on business
planning, practices, and implementation for curbing
energy use. Coupled with the already-completed
enterprise environmental management systems (ISO
14001), energy management systems are expected to
enhance the operational efficiency and environmental
performance of Kia Motors¡¯ worksites. We plan to
expand the scope of the certification to the Soha
and Hwaseong Plants as well service centers in 2013
while setting up energy management systems at all
our overseas worksites. Kia Motors will spearhead
efforts to creating a green society by minimizing
energy consumption and maximizing energy
efficiency.

Green Light of Hope in Africa
The year 2012 was meaningful in terms of our CSR
efforts as Kia Motors¡¯ social outreach projects in
Tanzania and Malawi went into full swing. With the
launch of the Green Light Project, Kia Motors is
bringing hope to Africa where even basic human
rights are forfeited due to limited mobility. Through
the Green Light Project, local communities are
provided with schools, modes of transport, medical
facilities, and other infrastructure that improve
their quality of life. Kia Motors aims to extend
opportunities for a better life to local residents and
ultimately build a basis for self-sufficient growth for
local communities.
To Kia Motors, social outreach is not just about mere
giving but rather social investment for long-term
mutual growth. We want to contribute to building a
sustainable society by working together to resolve
social challenges. We especially value ¡®togetherness,¡¯
which is why we collaborate with NGOs and local
agencies and work on creating a social outreachculture that encourages voluntary employee
participation. We look forward to a 2013 in which
our sincere efforts as a responsible corporate citizen
reinforce customer trust.
By putting ourselves in our customers¡¯ shoes, Kia
Motors provides true value that customers really
want. We will also continue to practice socially
responsible management, fulfilling our responsibilities

72,Kia Motors,3,Korea,"2014 Achievements
Kia Motors had a memorable year in 2014, our 70th anniversary
since foundation, with sales growing by 7.6 percent from the previous
year to reach 3.04 million vehicles. This was a monumental accomplishment,
as Kia sales exceeded the three million mark for the
first time in the half century since our first truck (the K-360) appeared
on roads back in 1962. Another significant milestone in 2014 was
the achievement of 30 million units in cumulative vehicle sales. Our
brand value also surged 15 percent from a year before to reach USD
5.4 billion, propelling Kia to 74th place among all global brands.
Also, our ranking on Interbrand¡¯s list of the 50 Best Global Green
Brands rose to 35th place in 2014.
In the meantime, our efforts to lay a firm foundation for sustainable
growth continued in 2014 with the groundbreaking of a new Kia
plant in Mexico that will produce 300,000 vehicles a year and the
finalization of plans to expand the production capacity of our third
plant in China.
All of these notable accomplishments could not have been possible
without the cooperation and support of our stakeholders for our
ceaseless pursuit of creating a better future through customer value
innovation.
The Post-3 Million Era
Having now opened the door to the three million unit era, Kia Motors
is now standing at a critical crossroads for its future sustainability.
Today¡¯s global economy is mired in slow growth, while political uncertainties
that began in emerging markets are now affecting neighboring
regions amidst intensifying competition in the global automobile
market.
Against this backdrop, Kia Motors is moving swiftly to carry on with
its quantitative and qualitative growth. This includes consistent work
to guarantee the world¡¯s highest quality in order to respond proactively
to customer demands while further raising Kia¡¯s brand value.
Our top priority will be green vehicles.
In response to environmental concerns and strengthening government
regulations, we have completed a mid- to long-term roadmap
for becoming a leader in the green car market by 2020. To that effect,
we are replacing 70 percent of our engine lineup with the aim
of enhancing the fuel efficiency of our vehicles by 25 percent by
2020, and plan to commercialize all of our eco-friendly technologies,
including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), electric vehicles (EVs) and
fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) by the same year. Moreover, we are
making significant investments in future vehicle technologies, such
as smart cars, to provide innovative mobility solutions for a higher
quality of life and a sustainable future.
Corporate Social Responsibility
At Kia Motors, we believe that corporate social responsibility is
about mutual respect, trust and growth through sharing value
with our stakeholders. Therefore, the balanced growth of both Kia
Motors and our stakeholders is just as important as the balanced
growth of our triple bottom line to ensure a sustainable future.
As partners, we share the goal of becoming a global leader in the
auto industry with our suppliers, just one of the stakeholders to
whom we are responsible. We now have in place a system for
mutual growth, assisting partners with their global competencybuilding
and various sustainability activities because we know that
their sustainable growth will eventually result in sustainable growth
for Kia Motors and our other stakeholders. In this same context, our
employees are important partners who are both the beneficiaries
and providers of our CSR services. In order to help them maintain
a healthy work-life balance, Kia Motors launched a company-wide
Smart Work Campaign in 2014. We also created a dedicated team
for the safety and health of all employees.
In 2014, as part of our commitment to create a better society for
all, we expanded the scope of our signature global CSR activity, the
Green Light Project, in which Kia Motors employees from around
the world come together to serve local residents in four African
countries. At Kia Motors, CSR doesn¡¯t stop with a one-time event
or simple donations. Instead, we believe that volunteering represents
CSR in its truest sense. The Green Light Project symbolizes
our commitment to genuine sharing and aims to ensure the right to
mobility for all people while promoting self-support of disadvantaged
local communities.
Building on our achievements to date, we will strive to further our
customer-oriented management practices as well as secure mid- to
long-term growth engines as a way of solidifying the foundation for
sustainable growth. Going beyond the simple purpose of a business?
profit generation?we will expand the scope of our sustainable
management activities by always taking into account society
and the environment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our executives and employees overcame such difficulties and helped KAC post the best financial outcome of KRW 650
billion in revenue and KRW 138 billion in net income last year.
KAC marks its 33rd anniversary this year, and although we have endured a variety of tribulations, we have earned the
highest rating in the management assessment of public enterprises. KAC has also topped ASQ for three consecutive
years, demonstrating our competitive edge against many different airports across the world. KAC is gearing up
sustainable management practices to establish footholds for sustainable growth and further advances.
This is KAC¡¯s fifth sustainability report after publishing our first report in 2009. These annual reports are designed to
communicate KAC¡¯s sustainability management practices and performances to stakeholders in a well-directed manner.
KAC has engaged in clean and transparent ethical management practices in 2012 as part of our efforts to ¡°spearhead
ethical management practices among public enterprises by preventing fraud and promoting integrity¡±. Our company
has been recognized for ¡°leadership in transparent management¡± for two years in a row. As we undertook efforts to

developed LED lamps, and established a carbon neutralization forest.
KAC has won the ¡°Social Contribution Corporate Award¡± in the category of supporting multicultural families for three
consecutive years in 2012. KAC associates also voluntarily donate a portion of their special bonus for the associates of
business partners as part of efforts to engage in inclusive growth initiatives.
KAC will continue efforts to create and distribute values by upgrading its operations and engaging in social
responsibility practices. I believe that KAC will continue its growth and prosperity by taking on new changes and
challenges in the future.

79,Korea Airports Corporation,2,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders,
It is my honor to share the sustainable management activities of Korea Airports
Corporation (KAC) as we strive to grow into a world-class airport operator.
Over the last 34 years, KAC has contributed to the development of the national
economy by efficiently constructing, managing, and operating airports, carrying
out air transport more smoothly, and enacting great efforts in realizing customer
satisfaction.
Despite various changes in the external environment such as a reforming
project of public institutions, KAC has been operating in the black for ten
consecutive years and recorded ¡°55 million passenger traffic¡±, which is our best
performance since its foundation. In Airport Service Quality (ASQ) conducted
by Airports Council International (ACI), Gimpo International Airport has been
ranked as the best airport among similar-sized airports for four years in a row,
demonstrating KAC¡¯s capability to operate airports. KAC also received Airport
Efficiency Excellence Award (¡®10, ¡®12 and ¡®13) for Asia-Pacific region from Air
Transport Research Society (ATRS). Based on these performances, we have
prepared to make another leap in progress under the slogan, ""A Second
Take-off of the Nation's Public Airport Corporation"". We are fulfilling our
social responsibilities in various sectors, including integrity, ethical and safety
management, social contribution, and mutual growth to create a foundation for
growth and development.
First of all, KAC has set our management policy for sustainable development
as ¡°KAC, a Company Based on Trust and Creativity¡±, and reinforced our pivotal
role not only in carrying out original roles such as managing and controlling
airports, but also in cultivating and supporting the overall airport industry. In line
with our original missions, we set the safety and security of airports as our top
priorities and carry out unceasing efforts to operate safe airports by performing
accident-prevention activities, globalizing airport-safety systems, and advancing
next-generation navigation technologies.
KAC has strived to establish a culture of transparency and integrity based on
this experience by recognizing integrity and ethics as directly related to our
company¡¯s survival and encouraging the participation of all executives and
employees although our rank for integrity has slightly fallen due to a series of
recent issues. In terms of transaction relations, the company prevents unfair
subcontracting transactions by strengthening regular monitoring activities
based on fairness and transparency. Along with aiming for realizing fair
transactions, we have realized mutual growth by supporting various partner
companies and carrying out businesses to support small and mid-sized
companies. Thanks to these efforts, the satisfaction of executives and employees
from partner companies has enhanced every year, and we have been appointed
as the best institution for public purchase in 2013.
KAC has been proactive in communicating with local residents around
our airports and established an information system to efficiently solve the
noise issue which directly affects their lives in operating airports. In addition,
we have prepared strategies and built firm cooperative relationships with
global institutions to systematically respond to various internal and external
environmental issues such as global warming. The development of eco-friendly
LED airfield lighting system significantly contributed to reducing GHG emissions
in operating airports. These efforts resulted in winning the Gold Prize in the
international business sector of the ¡°Green Apple Awards for 2013,¡± one of the
most prestigious eco-friendly awards in EU.
We have carried out various social contribution activities suitable for our
company¡¯s characteristics, such as programs supporting residents in noise
countermeasure areas and multi-cultural households. As a result, the company¡¯s
excellence in social activities has been recognized, and the company has
won the Best Award for Social Contribution for four consecutive years. KAC
has performed customized social contribution activities for each region by
proactively communicating with local communities and carried out global
contribution activities, which have helped to enhance the company¡¯s image
and support the growth of local communities.
Stakeholders,
KAC will continue its innovative activities by bravely responding to new changes
and challenges to make the leap into a world-class airport company. We will
strive to uphold our responsibilities as a public corporate member, sharing the
company¡¯s values with various stakeholders. We would greatly appreciate your
continuous interest and attention for KAC as we continue to create a better and
happier future.

It is my great pleasure to express my gratitude to your continuous interest and support through this year¡¯s sustainability report. As an operator of 14 airports
in the nation for the past 35 years, KAC has dedicated ourselves and contributed to developing the national economy by successfully constructing,
managing and operating airports and efficient air transportation and providing customers with best services.
In terms of the main field of air traffic, KAC has achieved the milestone of opening the era of enabling the access of air traffic for the entire public by reaching
passenger traffic of 61.66 million (increased by 11.7% compared to the previous year) with strategy of uniquely developing key airports and customized
efforts of vitalizing local airports despite adverse conditions to manage such as low Japanese currency and expansion of competitive transportation
markets such as KTX. Through various support for low-cost carriers, the ratio of passengers for LCCs has significantly increased, while LCCs¡¯ services at local
airports increased to enable the people to use air traffic more conveniently at lower costs.
KAC makes a leap forward into the world as No. 1 in management assessment, service, and efficiency
Based on these results, KAC has achieved the best performance by receiving the A level in the Public Enterprise Management Assessment 2014, which
is carried out by the government for public enterprises. As executives and employees¡¯ high level of ethical awareness and systemic work performance
methods were recognized, the company has won the ¡°Ethical Management Best Prize¡± from Korea Order Economics Association. In terms of international
recognition, Gimpo International Airport inducted in ACI Director¡¯s Roll of Excellence by achieving the world¡¯s first rank for five consecutive years in the
Airport Service Quality (ASQ) surveyed by Airport Council International (ACI). All the core airports operated by KAC have ranked among the top positions
in the Operating Efficiency Assessment for Asian region by Air Transport Research Society (ATRS), which authority is equivalent to the Nobel Prize in the
aviation industry: Jeju International Airport has ranked in the first place, followed by Gimhae International Airport as the second and Gimpo International
Airport as the fourth.
World-class company with the aim of transforming an airport operator into a leader of the aviation industry
With the amendment of Korea Airports Corporation Act in last year, KAC prepares for its second takeoff, pioneering new growth businesses beyond its existing
business as an airport operator. Although Korea has currently experienced a gradual increase in demand for aviation and flights, there is an absolute
shortage of pilots; to address this issue, KAC plans to carry out new business projects for cultivating pilots. With the aim of creating new growth engines,
the company plans to conduct new business products such as constructing overseas airports, exporting the Air Navigation System, and aircraft fueling
and repairing business for supporting the competitiveness of the country¡¯s low-cost carriers. The company also strives to fulfill its corporate social responsibility
in various perspectives such as ethical management with integrity, coping with climate change, social contribution, win-win growth with suppliers,
and improvement of work culture for executives and employees.
Pledging to ¡°Gentle¡± Management that does not discriminate against passengers with special needs in 2015 which marks
the 35th corporate anniversary
In 2015, KAC will enact greater efforts to become a public enterprise that gains trust of the public in every aspect, from its systems to employees¡¯ mindset.
First, the company has begun to provide customized services so that the passengers with special needs?such as people with disabilities, pregnant women,
and seniors?can use airports operated by KAC conveniently and safely. Based on these efforts, 2015 will be the first year of removing barriers in using
airports to allow all people to use airports in an easy and convenient way. The company will endeavor to build a corporate image suitable to the A-level
which it has earned in the fair and reasonable management assessment by applying a gentle and considerate attitude in treating anyone, including customers,
stakeholders, and even rival companies. Marking its 35th anniversary this year, KAC has already presented a broad vision to become a ¡°world-class
airport operator creating Biz & Life¡± and will continue to tackle challenges and create innovation to fulfill its role as a ¡°public enterprise for the public¡± with
safe and convenient wings for the happiness of the public.
I ask for your continuous attention in KAC¡¯s robust takeoff for tomorrow.
Thank you.
Sincerely,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,Korea East-West Power Corporation,3,Korea,"Thank you for your continued support which made our sustainable management possible.
We, EWP, are a public corporation which communicate with our interested parties via energy and cooperate with them to grow together,
to create 'happiness energy' as we endeavor to carry on our missions. The 9th sustainability report issued this year contains contents on our
efforts on the key mission of the company, which is to provide power with stability, as well as other efforts for growths in terms of economy,
society, and environmental aspects for 2014.
Since our foundation in April 2001, we have been doing our best to become a beloved energy corporation and fulfill our duties as such a
company, with our priority firmly set on stable power supply. Last year, we contributed further to stabilization of power supply by completing
our No. 4 Ulsan Compound Thermal power plant. Out achievement for the year also include reaching 200 day without any failure in all
of our generation units and 265 days without any breakdowns with our entire coal thermal power generation units (500MW), which is an
unprecedented achievement through the history of power generation in Korea.
Also, as we performed our corporate rationalization program for 2014, we could be ranked as No. 1 in the interim assessment of public
corporations, thank to the commitment and devotion by our entire employees. We ranked No. 1 in the anti-corruption policy assessment
organized by ACRC for three years in a row. Also, we maintained the highest grade in co-prosperity assessments for 6 years in a row, selected
as the best HRD corporation in the public sector, and awarded with the grand prize for family-friendly management. Our sustainability
management achievements also include the first-ever book-reading management certification among the entire public corporations in
Korea.
In addition, in June 2014, we moved the HQ of the company to Ulsan, in accordance with the government¡¯s policy to move the HQs of
the public corporations to non-capital areas, and utilize this as a new opportunity to lead forward to another phase of our growth. We
established a social contribution integration brand, 'Happiness Energy Dream' which is in conjunction with the purpose of foundation of
the company. With this, we established for sectors of clean energy, healing energy, hope energy, and smile energy, as we engage in social
responsibility activities based on Happiness Energy Dream programs. We also create shared-value type community co-prosperity models
including development of agricultural complexes using the high temperature water discharge, and completion of the Shared Sunshine Power
Generation plant which was built for the first time in Korea using Crowd Funding method to induce participation by citizens.
We clearly understand that our achievements for the past 14 years are based on the trust and love extended to us by the respected interested
parties, such as the government, the customers, the local communities, the related public organizations, business partners, and employees.
We will continue to communicate with these parties through our brand of 'Happiness Energy' and develop our company into a co-prospering
community of companies as we create more shared values. Thank you for your support for our sustained growth and brighter future.
Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
533,Korea East-West Power Corporation,4,Korea,"Dear EWP stakeholders,
I am deeply grateful for your keen attention and support of the sustainability management efforts of East-West Power Co., Ltd. (EWP). In 2006, EWP declared its full support of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in the areas of labor, human rights, environment and anti-corruption and published its first sustainability management report. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the report, which I am extremely happy about and proud of.
EWP has continued to achieve outstanding management results over the years despite the difficult business environment caused by changes in the government's policies at home and fluctuations in the international energy markets. However, the demand for eco-friendly energy keeps rising throughout the world in the wake of the first-ever universal global climate deal that was adopted in 2015, weakening the stature of the thermal power generation industry. EWP has re-established the corporate vision for its sustainability management. It accelerates innovation in the following three areas with the purpose of actively coping with the ongoing changes in the worlds' social and environmental paradigms and developing into a power generation company that continues to achieve sustainable corporate growth down the road.
First, EWP strives to gain momentum for sustainable corporate growth through the development of new growth engines and supplying stable and economic electricity. We raked 1st in fuel costs for standard coal-fired power generation for six straight years through economical procurement of power generation fuels. In addition, we achieved another accident-free period of 200 days for all of our power generators in 2015. We build and operate a 1,000 MW-class high-efficiency USC power plant in Dangjin for the first time in Korea.
Second, to make sustainable society and govern corporate social responsibility EWP actively handles global environmental initiatives issues such as developing renewable energy, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Remarkably, we are also enhancing our portfolio of new and renewable energy having shifted focus away from fossil fuels. In addition, EWP reduced 1.82 million tons of GHG emissions more than allocated by the government, and achieved the highest score in the power generation industry in the Competitiveness Index in Climate Change for five consecutive years.
Third, EWP strives to create a flexible, creative corporate culture in the safest work environment to be able to thrive in any business environment in the future. We are currently making 'innovations in the way we operate' by incorporating flexible, creative software including systematic arrangements to our well-established 'Smart Office' hardware so that all of our employees can put their creativity to work. Meanwhile, EWP has placed the utmost priority on its employees' safety. In recognition of our extraordinary achievements in this field, we were able to be ranked the highest in the 2016 Safe Korea Anti-disaster Exercise for three consecutive years, a first among public institutions under the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; topped the list of exemplary companies in the government's Disaster & Safety Management Evaluation for two straight years.
I would like to take this opportunity to convey my special thanks to you for your extraordinary support and cooperation during the past 10 years, without which we could not have made the achievements that we have claimed in our annual sustainability reports over the past decade. In a bid to live up to your expectations, EWP will continue to fulfill its social responsibilities based on its high level of ethical awareness and integrity. I personally pledge to continue to listen to your voices through diverse communication channels with humility and open-mindedness. I will be looking forward to your continuous encouragement and support for the company's sustainable growth and promising future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

87,"Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power co, LTD",3,Korea,"To whom it may concern,
In 2014, KHNP established a new set of five core values, Technology, Respect, Ultimate safety, Social responsibility, and Timeless integrity (TRUST), in order to pursue a
new direction of the company¡¯s vision, ¡®KHNP, the Reliable Global Energy Leader¡¯. The utmost priority among the core values is the Ultimate Safety. In this regard, KHNP has
endeavored to secure the highest standard of safety technologies while pursuing the timeless values of integrity and a strong ethical foundation. The company has been
building a corporate culture respect each other among employees, improvement of world-class technical skills and advancement of ethical management. Our company
stands in the forefront of social contribution and environmental protection to fulfill its social responsibilities as a public company.
Remarkable results have been achieved in different parts of our business operation after all of the management and the employees refresh their mindset. I must praise
the determination and dedication of our management and employees on how they have performed their duty to the fullest. The nuclear power utilization rate was
increased to 85% in 2014, and the accumulative power generation rate was reached 3 trillion kWh in April 2015 in the 37 years of operating nuclear power plants. The
annual revenue in 2014 was KRW 9.5 trillion, which is a 48.5% increase from 2013, and the net income was KRW 1.44 trillion.
To ensure KHNP¡¯s sustainability, we need our stakeholders¡¯ support. Like the Korean proverb ¡®Su-jeok-seok-cheon¡¯, which means constant dripping of water eventually
breaks a rock, we will continue to grow and overcome any obstacles in our way.
KHNP has a global reputation for safe nuclear power plant operations. We are ranked 2nd on the World Association of Nuclear Operators
(WANO) safety performance evaluation, an overall checkup of operational and safety capabilities of nuclear power plant operation
companies worldwide. This is the result of setting safety as the top priority and all of our employees making tremendous efforts to
internalize the safety culture. KHNP has constantly sought a better safety practices and actively improved safety standards through
safety evaluation for nuclear plants in Korea and abroad. In accordance with the Korea government¡¯s policies, the number of nuclear
power plants will increase to 35 by 2030. KHNP is preparing for future expansions by enhancing technologies and securing experts to
strengthen the overall capability.
To fulfill our social responsibilities, KHNP has organized social contribution activities for the general public and for communities around its
nuclear power plants. KHNP is also making efforts to build a robust ecosystem of nuclear power industry by supporting small and medium
sized suppliers for mutual growth. Our sincere communications and efforts towards a symbiotic coexistence have resolved several conflicts,
especially in the areas of local residents¡¯ negative perceptions regarding nuclear power plants. After 15 years, negotiations on Shin-Hanul
nuclear power construction have finally reached a resolution in November 2014. Wolsong #1 that was stopped for 946 days after the operation
permit expired but it was restarted in June 2015 after reaching agreements with local residents.
These noteworthy results are achieved through active communications with all of our stakeholders, including the Korea government,
regional governments and local residents. Based on an empowered trust gained from mutual understanding and shared concerns, we
will continue our efforts to communicate with our stakeholders via various channels.
KHNP has strengthening its position as a global energy leader through continuous technical development. In 2014, KHNP acquired
a national standard design approval of our next generation new nuclear power plant ¡®APR+¡¯. ¡®APR 1400¡¯ is the Korean nuclear power
plant and it was successfully exported to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It passed the preliminary examination for the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) design certification. According to the Korean Nuclear Safety and Security Commission¡¯s decision on the
close of Kori #1, KHNP is planning to take proactive steps to compete in the upcoming decommissioning market based on its reactor
disassembly techniques and business foundation. With the UAE project as a showcase of the KHNP¡¯s international business, KHNP will
become a ¡®Global Energy Leader¡¯ by exporting more nuclear and hydroelectric power plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
534,"Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power co, LTD",4,Korea,"Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power has continued a journey toward realizing the vision of ¡°KHNP, the Reliable Global Energy Leader¡± as we
committed to safe nuclear operation and new growth engine development. As a result, in 2015, we recorded the best-ever operating
performances since the establishment by achieving KRW 10.7 trillion in sales and KRW 250 billion in net income. Particularly, our all-out
efforts at stable supply of electric power and safe nuclear operation have resulted in a dramatic reduction in failures, allowing us to
record a remarkable NPP usage of 85.3%. We also resolved key issues like continued operation permit of Wolsong #1. In July 2016, we
demonstrated once again our excellence in nuclear operation by concluding the OSSA (Operating Support Services Agreement) after
completing the construction of the four nuclear plants in UAE.
What makes year 2016 especially meaningful for KHNP is that we relocated to Gyeongju this year. Having moved into the new HQ in April,
KHNP embarked on a fresh journey toward the energy future of Korea. The slogan ¡°New & Clear Energy Silk Road¡± represents our aspiration
of ¡°trailblazing a new Silk Road with nuclear energy in Gyeongju.¡± Under the slogan, we are carrying out 5 key projects aimed at
co-prosperity with Gyeongju and 10 key projects for local communities in the city. KHNP is now poised to make a second leap forward to
stand tall in the global arena while re-establishing itself as a corporation respected by local citizens that lives up to the expectations of our
time to contribute to the balanced regional development. To that end, KHNP commits itself to delivering on the following three promises:
It is our responsibility to form the foundation to win trust from the general public to ensure stable supply of electric power through safe
nuclear operation. Having set safety as the top priority, KHNP strives to foster safety-first culture and attain the world-class technology.
We also seek to advance nuclear plant operation and management system while enhancing employee capabilities and facility reliability
to embrace for operation expansion. We pledge to maintain strict security measures both in online and physical environment.
Nuclear industry cannot grow without support and trust from local communities and the general public. KHNP pledges to reach out to
people in a closer communication, thereby resolving issues facing us. It is also our responsibility to seek shared growth with suppliers
and build a sound and future-oriented industrial ecosystem. By establishing the supply chain management system rooted upon the winwin
partnership, we will ensure transparency and competitive edge of the nation¡¯s nuclear business.
KHNP is focusing on enhancing comprehensive capabilities to deliver the next 15 years of greater growth over the past 15 years, 30 years
of trust and respect from people, and 100 years of the national energy security. For starter, we will engage employees, suppliers, and
local communities in open communication for the successful completion of Shin-Kori #3 and #4 projects and smooth promotion of new
projects such as Cheonji nuclear power plant in Yeongdeok. Other focuses will be on developing the OSSA, recently signed with UAE,
into a new business model, and extending our nuclear power, hydropower, and renewable energy businesses abroad. We will also expedite
the completion of the entire cycle of nuclear plant construction-operation- decommissioning by securing technologies for reactor
decommissioning and used nuclear fuel treatment.
Valued stakeholders,
KHNP is committed to safe nuclear operation, rising into a ¡°corporation that fosters the nation¡¯s economic growth,¡± ¡°global energy leader
generating new growth engine,¡± and ¡°a corporate citizen trusted by people fulfilling its social responsibility.¡± I would appreciate your
lasting support and encouragement as we continue to deliver sustainable management.

88,Korea Resources Corporation,3,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders of Korea Resources Corporation,
I first would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest thanks for your unwavering support. KORES operates under our mission of ¡°contribution to national economic development by stably supplying mineral resources¡± and also contributes Korea¡¯s manufacturing competiveness by leading the national industry¡¯s future. Also, as Korea¡¯s sole state-owned mining company, we fulfill our social responsibility as we aim to become one of the world¡¯s top 20 mining companies by 2020s.
First, we place utmost efforts on securing the profitability of all our projects and the stabilization of our overseas projects. Price declines in global mineral markets and an increase in our debt ratio has resulted in higher financial risk. As a result, we have established Risk Management Team to secure the profitability of KORES¡¯s operations by enhancing our core business management practices. We are studying the feasibility of various highly economic projects that are aligned with our business strategy which is in turn based on quality growth.
Second, as Korea¡¯s sole state-owned mining company, we take responsibility for win-win growth, with one of our most important roles being to ensure mining SMEs can secure stable mineral supply. Furthermore, in order to create a sustainable domestic mineral and energy ecosystem, we are improving our scope for social responsibility by expanding our Benefit Sharing Model to include our second and third tier suppliers. We are also actively supporting Korean SMEs¡¯ overseas expansion through our Resource Development Model.
Third, as a global mining company, we are strengthening our human rights and environmental policies. KORES has been a supporter of the UN Global Compact¡¯s 10 Principles since 2007. While developing its human rights framework in 2015, KORES extended its scope for social responsibility to that of our suppliers and communities in overseas. We also introduced an Environmental Technology Team to strictly manage the environmental impact of all our operational sites. In particular, enhancing eco-friendly mineral resource development technology to enable SMEs to adopt environmentally friendly technology throughout the entire mining development cycle.
Since the relocation of our headquarters on 1st of July, 2015, we have begun our new future in Wonju Innovation City. We plan to build close relationships with the local community through the introduction of long-term focused social contribution programs which reflect our stakeholders¡¯ expectations.
We hope to lead mineral market stability and the sustainability of Korea¡¯s economic development through a high level of transparency and social responsibility. I sincerely thank all our stakeholders - our employees, the government and other related institutions, partners, suppliers, and local communities - for accompanying Korea Resources Corporation¡¯s long journey and ask for their ongoing support.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

93,Korea Telecom,3,Korea,"In 2014, kt made various efforts for management innovation to prepare for the upcoming future with renewed
determination.
When it comes to internal matters, we have established a communication and collaboration system to improve
corporate culture and amplify synergy. The new culture is geared towards realizing empowerment of field
employees, so they could work with more authority and responsibility, and thus enhance business performances.
Externally, with the aim of leaping forward as ¡°Global No. 1,¡± kt proclaimed ¡°GiGAtopia¡± as its new goal and
presented a new paradigm in the wired and wireless communications market through five future business areas
such as IoT, big data, healthcare, next generation media, and integrated safety.
¡°GiGAtopia¡± is a world with greater safety, comfort, and happiness through various convergence services based on
GiGA infrastructure. To achieve this goal, kt is fostering small but strong companies in Korea that we call K-Champ,
like the hidden champions, the main source of Germany¡¯s economic growth.
In March 2015, we opened the Creative Economy Innovation Center in Pangyo, the cradle for K-Champ. The center
will not only contribute to creative economy by leading the global standardization of new technologies, but also
target the global market by creating an ICT ecosystem where large companies and small but strong companies grow
together.
Furthermore, as the representative company and with the desire to contribute to the improvement of the world
through ICT, kt has carried out various activities for creating shared value based on GiGA service.
Last year, the first GiGA Island was launched at Imjado Island in Korea, while GiGA School was opened at
Daeseongdong Elementary School in the demilitarized zone (i.e. highly restricted area between North and
South Korea). Through these efforts, kt enabled residents to enjoy the benefits of innovative ICT including smart
agriculture, healthcare, and education.

91,Korean Air,1,Korea,"Dear stakeholders,
Let me first express my deep gratitude for your support for Korean Air.
Korean Air has thrived on its close relationship with various stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, employees and their family members,
business partners, local communities, NGOs and the government, in the economic, environmental and social areas.
Korean Air has published its Sustainability Report since 2006 for more effective communication with its stakeholders. I am pleasured to share with you
Korean Air¡¯s achievements through its 2013 Sustainability Report.
In 2012, Korean Air set a goal of promoting communication between the company and other members of society and focused on building mutual
trust, and this trust enabled the company to get over the challenges arising from the global economic slump and high oil prices. These challenges still
remain and the business landscape surrounding the company is changing so fast. In view of this, efforts to closely work and grow together with all groups of
our stakeholders will be needed more than ever and accordingly, Korean Air chose ¡°Traveling with You¡± as the core value of its business activities for 2013.
¡°Traveling together¡± is not about going alone; it is about going together. While traveling together, you need to keep pace and listen to your partner¡¯s
voice. Internally, we will share values, put company benefits before ours and promote harmony among each other. Externally, we will endeavor to make
a warm-hearted society, sharing our benefits with our neighbors.
To this end, we will concentrate on achieving solid growth by establishing stable sources of revenue and improving our fundamentals rather than
being intent on quantitative expansion. We will maximize efficiency and productivity by mobilizing all our management resources such as new aircraft,
network and global talent, as well as reinforce sales so as to generate stable profits in any given situation. In addition, we will make new products and
new growth engines with unique ideas and creativity.
Since Korean Air announced its commitment to conserving the environment in the 1990s, the company has conducted an array of programs
such as global reforestation project, introduction of next-generation eco-friendly aircraft with less carbon emissions and noise and efficient use of energy.
Also as a leading carrier of SkyTeam, a global airline alliance, the company is striving to effectively address global warming and other environmental
issues facing the airline industry.
This year, Korean Air launched a community service group at the group level in a bid to take an integrated approach to all CSR activities and expand
their scope, believing that the spirit of sharing is the foundation of a healthy society. Our integrated CSR program called ¡°WITH¡± offers CSR activities
that Korean Air is in a good position to carry out. Along with these efforts, Korean Air will also endeavor to facilitate mutual growth with its business
partners and co-prosperity with its local communities through diverse communication channels.
Korean Air has always brought innovation and change to its operations and corporate culture for greater customer satisfaction. Keeping in
mind our stakeholders¡¯ special love for us as well as their expectations, Korean Air will travel with all our stakeholders for a new tomorrow.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Korean Air,3,Korea,"Dear stakeholders,
First, I would like to express my heartfelt
gratitude for your unwavering support for,
and interest in, Korean Air. We at Korean Air
take great pride in providing world-class air
travel services to our customers, and have
been striving ceaselessly to become a leading
global airline that represents Korea, by constantly
embracing changes and innovations.
We are fully aware that all the successes and
achievements that we have made so far were
only made possible by your enduring support
and encouragement. This 10th Sustainability
Report that we are about to publish presents
the results of our efforts to achieve sustainability
during 2014. The report is also intended
to serve as an important channel of communication
with our stakeholders.
Looking back, the first half of 2014 was a
testing time for all of us amid the prolonged
economic slowdown and the repercussions
of the sinking of the Sewol passenger ferry,
while the business environment saw a turn
for the better in the second half following a
drop in the price of oil fell. On the other hand,
we deeply regret that the incident involving
Korean Air stirred up a huge social controversy
and caused a great deal of distress to
our stakeholders. However, I would like to
assure you that we have learned our lessons
and that we remain determined to take this
opportunity to transform the way we do our
business, rather than merely viewing it as a
case of crisis management, so that we can
regain your trust and confidence.
The year 2014 marked our 45th anniversary,
for which we set ourselves the goal of ¡®boosting
our growth momentum by improving the
fundamentals of our business¡¯ for 2014. To
attain this goal, we made aggressive efforts
toward developing markets with growth potential.
Two A380 aircraft were added to our
fleet to improve our passenger services, and
currently a total of ten A380 airplanes fly longdistance
routes to major global hubs including
Los Angeles, New York, Paris, and Atlanta.
In addition, we opened a new route to Houston,
the largest city in Texas, U.S., further
augmenting our global network.
We installed the latest models of high-efficiency
equipment and machinery, secured
business with global corporations, and made
inroads into new markets such as Vietnam
and Central and South America in order to
raise the profitability of our cargo business.
Korean Air also began competing globally as a
developer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
after developing Korea¡¯s first indigenous unmanned
aerial reconnaissance vehicle.We expect that many challenges and opportunities
lie ahead in 2015, and believe that establishing
a culture of flexibility and creativity
will be essential if we are to bring about the
necessary changes and make a new leap forward.
We will overhaul management system
to ensure that employees can perform their
duties most efficiently, and improve corporate
culture with a focus on effective communication
and consensus-building, by collecting
diverse opinions from within and outside the
organization.
Furthermore, we will expand our growth potential
by maximizing profit. Our management
goal for 2015 is 'creating profit in all business
areas by enhancing profitability and expanding
growth potential.' In response to the growing
competition brought about by low-cost airlines
and the entry of foreign airlines into the
Korean market, Korean Air plans to put hightech
airplanes with cutting-edge first-class
and business seats such as the B747-8i and
the B777-300ER onto long-distance routes,
while disposing of old airplanes such as the
B747-400 in a bid to upgrade and modernize
its fleet. Korean Air also plans to launch new
routes to major cities in China, including Hefei,
Nanning, and Guiyang, and to increase the
flights on key routes including Dubai.
Our plans for 2015 include our social responsibilities
as a corporate citizen. Korean Air
has been involved in a variety of social activities
including planting trees in the Kubuqi Desert
of China and Mongolia, implementing the
¡®Global Planting Project,¡¯ which is aimed at
making the inner city of Los Angeles greener,
sponsoring Korean language services at the
world¡¯s major museums, supporting disaster-
struck areas, and sponsoring a variety of
sporting and cultural events. As a participant
in the UN Global Compact, Korean Air follows
its ten principles in the fields of human rights,
labor, environment, and anti-corruption, and
will do its best to be a corporate citizen that
earns the respect of communities and stakeholders
alike.
We celebrated our 45th anniversary in 2014
and, once again, we would like to stress our
appreciation of the support that you have
shown for Korean Air. Over the past 45 years,
Korean Air has been dedicated to carrying passengers
and cargos safely around the world.
All the officers and employees of Korean Air
devoted themselves to faithfully fulfilling the
duties of transporting people and cargoes,
and its social responsibilities as the nationalflag
carrier, thereby eventually contributing to
the advancement of Korean society.
Just as it has survived numerous challenges
and difficulties over the past 45 years, Korean
Air will continue with its efforts to become a
truly great company by taking full advantage
of its know-how as well as the advice and
support of its stakeholders. Finally, I humbly
ask you to provide continued support as we
grow with you.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
501,Korean Air,4,Korea,"I¡¯m pleased to present to you the eleventh
edition of our report covering sustainability
management efforts and performance. On
behalf of everyone at Korean Air, I¡¯d like to
deliver a heartfelt gratitude to you for your
continued support and encouragement.
In 2015, Korean Air was faced with a challenging
market riddled with unforeseen
variables arising from the MERS outbreak
right in the run-up to its high-demand season
and terrorist attacks around the world.
Despite these challenges, we strategically
adjusted our route operations amid falling
oil prices and rising market demands for air
transportation as well as its volatility. As a
result, we were able to generate a KRW 859
billion operating profit.
The passenger flight business channeled
its resources into creating a niche for premium
customer services, adopting stateof-
the-art new aircrafts, like the B747-8i,
and increasing the fleet of A380 on major
routes. New routes were added to the cities
of Hefei, Nanning and Guiyang, helping reinforce
our service network in China.
Non-scheduled services were also expanded
on long-haul routes to Barcelona, Calgary
and Athens.
Meanwhile, the cargo business concentrated
on enhancing its profitability in 2015,
feeding the pursuit of new markets in Latin
America and Vietnam, while also modernizing
cargo fleet with the B747-8F and B777F,
which were able to enhance fuel efficiency.
Notably, the aerospace business significantly
raised its revenue and operating profit
aided by the manufacturing of civil craft
components, like composite structures for
the B787 and sharklets for A320, in addition
to the developing of medium-altitude unmanned
aerial vehicles (MA UAV) and the
upgrading of the performance of maritime
patrol aircrafts.
In meeting the volatile market environment
with a low-growth global economy, as well
as the U.S. FRD¡¯s rate hikes and geopolitical
risks, Korean Air grounded its 2016
management policy in the objective to not
only achieve sustainable profitability, but
also lay the foundation for the stable growth
of our company. While staying a step ahead
of the rapidly changing aviation industry,Korean Air will lead the trend with its
change-inducing and innovative new trend
and value system.
With that concerted effort working as our
driving dynamic, we lay the groundwork for
a stable profitability, and while we further
the consolidation of our operational safety
framework thanks to our thorough response
system, Korean Air continues to advance
both its evolvement and progress
centering itself around a genuine form of
customer-oriented service.
At the same time, our constructing a more
open and creative corporate culture motivates
us to revamp the entire administrative
and management system for bettered organizational
efficiency and communication,
which will be guided by the encouragement
of active communication and consensus
among all employees. We also work towards
becoming even more receptive when
it comes to the voices of internal and external
stakeholders so that we may successfully
continue with the reforming of our corporate
culture.
Remaining steadfast in its fulfillment of social
responsibilities, Korean Air offers its
signature CSR programs like afforestation
in deforesting areas of China and Mongolia
and sponsoring Korean language service at
world-renowned museums. We also anticipate
the continuation of disaster relief operations
and patronization of various sports
and cultural activities.
As an ardent proponent of the UN Global
Compact, Korean Air abides by all the ten
principles concerning human rights, labor,
the environment, and anti-corruption. As
such, we work hard to live up to our social
responsibility in becoming that of a business
organization respected by its community
and stakeholders all around.
Over the past 46 years, Korean Air has been
faithfully serving the country with its nation-
leading air transportation business
and striving to fulfill its corporate social responsibility
through various environmental
management and social contribution activities.
Just as we¡¯ve always done in the midst
of endless challenges, we will continue
striding into a brighter future toward sustainable
growth. While on this journey, the
advice and encouragement from our stakeholders
will be the key momentum that enables
us to move forward, and we, at Korean
Air, would be grateful for your continued
support.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,Kumho Tires,1,Korea,"We have been faced with continued difficult business conditions in
Korea and abroad : our management improvement process was
initiated in 2010, a self-initiated product recall decision was made in
China in 2011 and we suffered declining tire demand due to the intensifying
global economic downturn that started in Europe in 2012. Yet,
these challenges failed to shake our firm commitment to normalizing
our business operations. In fact, we even took a step further to lay the
foundation for sustainable business. As a result, we posted an annual
average growth of 7.4% from 2010, while our consolidated operating
profit turned positive in 2010 and we were able to post a growth of 9.2%
in operating margins in 2012. Furthermore, our debt-to-equity ratio
(according to the head office), improved significantly from 500% at the
end of 2010 to around 200% by the end of 2012. This was due to paidin
capital increases and a growth in retained earnings.
As the price of manufactured goods decrease, due to technological
advancement and the emerging global economy, a greater number
of people on this globe are able to enjoy a flourishing life in multiple
aspects. These benefits, however, should be balanced against the
growing concerns over the depletion of natural resources, environmental
degradation, the widening wealth gap and other phenomena,
where the consequences of such economic growth are passed down
to future generations to be contended with. As such, companies today
are required to take into account the interest of diverse stakeholderswhich
range from customers and shareholders-to local communities,
employees and suppliers.
As a way to respond to this urgent challenge of our time, we at Kumho
Tires, a member of Kumho Asiana Group, are fully committed to
achieving the group-wide mission of ¡°Improving the quality of life for
all of Kumho Asiana¡¯s stakeholders¡±.
We have been intensively investing in the R&D of eco-friendly product
line-ups in order to proactively address the eco-labeling programs
of multiple countries that aim to restrain carbon emissions. Such
endeavors allowed ecowing S, our representative eco-friendly tire
model, to be chosen as the Green Product of the Year in 2012 once
again, as it had in 2011. Each ecowing S tire helps reduce 272 kg in
annual CO2 emissions and 115 liters in gasoline consumption, (compared
to its conventional counterparts). These reductions are equal
in benefit to planting 48 trees a year.
Moreover, our social contribution initiatives, such as the scholarship
programs launched in China and Vietnam and the Pink Ribbon Campaign
in Korea, are intended to care for the less-privileged members
of our society and offer educational opportunities to future generations.
As a way to facilitate communication and boost morale among
our staff working both in Korea and overseas, regular initiatives are
being undertaken to build closer ties between top management and
working-level employees while TOP, TPM and other management
innovation programs are under operation. To promote mutually-beneficial
partnerships with our suppliers, we sign mutually-beneficial
management agreements and operate support programs that meet
the needs of our suppliers. Furthermore, our sales coaching program
aims to promote the retail distribution network(including TIRE
PRO), while unlimited support is offered to help dealership owners
generate stable profits.
Unfortunately, tough internal situations prevented us from publishing
sustainability reports since our last such report in 2007. Thus, our
2012 Sustainability Report clearly demonstrates that we are on the
right track to regain operational stability. As the year 2013 marks our
53rd anniversary since our establishment, we intend to view this report
as an opportunity to extend our previous environmently-focused
perspective into a company-wide perspective that spans the areas
of governance, economy, environment, labor, human rights, society
and quality. Moreover, we take this opportunity to paint an honest
picture of our strengths and weaknesses in advancing sustainability
management so that the status of our progress may clearly be communicated
to our stakeholders.
As we are fully aware-that as a company, we cannot stand on our
feet alone, and that our existence is guaranteed only through shared
growth with stakeholders, we are committed to undertaking a multitude
of socially responsible business initiatives as a way to become a
company that is truly loved and admired by society and our customers.
Your unsparing interest and encouragement will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,Kumho Tires,2,Korea,"We at Kumho Tire take great pleasure in
issuing our annual sustainability report for
2013/2014 following our previous annual
sustainability report for 2012/2013.
For us, the period 2013-2014 marked the
second half of our efforts to streamline our
business management practices. To complete
our endeavors toward that end, we strove to
boost our profitability while making essential
investments throughout the period.
In 2013 in particular, we recorded consolidated
Salesof KRW 3.6985 trillion and operating
profit of KRW 345.9 billion (equivalent to
operating profit margin of 9.4%), continuing
the streak of year-on-year operating profits
since we were forced into workout in 2010.
As a result, in 2013, the debt ratio of our
headquarters dropped below the 200%
threshold, a remarkable improvement
compared to the debt ratio of 497% recorded
at the end of 2010. The ratio further declined
to below the 150% mark as of the end of
September 2014.
Fully aware of the importance of sustainable
growth, we at Kumho Tire moved our research
center to a new building in Yongin ? whose
construction cost nearly KRW 100 billion ? in
September 2013. We have continued to work
hard to boost our R&D capabilities with the
goal of hiring up to 1,000 researchers.
Based on such research infrastructure, we
have signed a major contract for technological
alliance with Yokohama Rubber Corporation,
Japan and successfully implemented
technological exchanges and joint research on
future technologies with the firm.
Through this technological alliance, we expect
to raise the proportion of our R&D
investments to our sales from below 3% to
close to 5% and engage in research and
development activities comparable to those of
the global leaders in the industry.
Moreover, in the second half of 2014, we
resumed the construction of our new plant in
Georgia, USA, which had been discontinued
for a while.
With additional investment of US$413 million,
we will equip the plant with cutting-edge,
automated production facilities. We will
introduce the concept of ¡°operation
innovation¡± at the construction stage and
make the plant the most efficient production
facility in the world.
The construction of our Georgia plant is
progressing well, with the goal of launching
mass production in January 2016 and securing
production capacity of 4 million units upon
completion of the project now looking
attainable.
Dear Stakeholders
GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) G4, the global
sustainability reporting guidelines, has
reinforced indicators related to an organization¡¯s
performance in the areas of environment, labor,
human rights, society, and governance to
promote fairness and value distribution. As
indicated by such shifts of focus, an enterprise¡¯s
socially responsible business management is
becoming even more important for any firm
doing business in any part of the globe.
In keeping with this trend, global tire
manufacturers are working hard to realize the
sustainable development of the tire industry.
As a member of the tire subcommittee of
WBCSD (World Business Council for
Sustainable Development), we are taking
active measures in sync with other member
companies to address environmental issues
such as tire wear particles, particulate matter,
and waste tire management.
We at Kumho Tire are also striving to become a
¡°Beautiful Company¡± that fulfills its social
responsibilities and makes significant
contributions to society. We are spearheading
the development of eco-friendly products
through the environment-friendly tires Ecowing
S and WATTRUN while actively pursuing winwin
business management with our partner
companies. We are also offering extended
warranty for full customer satisfaction and
striving to expand our social contributions.
At the same time, we are enhancing our
ethical management system to be recognized
as a respectable corporate citizen through the
operation of the Ethical Management
Committee and Self-Monitoring Corps, in
addition to implementing a whistleblowing
system.
Dear Respected Stakeholders
We are now publishing our third sustainability
report in the hopes that we will be able to
communicate with you about all our endeavors
most effectively.
In this report, we at Kumho Tire have tried to
identify all the material issues for our
stakeholders and to highlight our sustainability
business management achievements in those
areas. We will continue to implement all tasks
related to our sustainability management
strategies most faithfully. We will also
endeavor for better governance and expansion
of our sustainability management practices
across the globe.
I look forward to your continued interest in
and support for our efforts. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,Kumho Tires,3,Korea,"We at Kumho Tire are very pleased to issue our annual sustainability report for 2014, the fourth
report following our previous annual sustainability report for 2013.
In 2014, the global economy entered a moderate recovery path in developed countries, including
North America and Europe. The tire market rose to about 5% from the previous year of 2013, driven
by an increase in sales in the forward linkage industry. However, this year marked an unstable
management environment, because there was fierce competition in the wake of stable price trends
in lower-cost raw materials. Despite the company's seemingly sluggish external growth due to
intensified price competition from the weak yen and global overproduction, Kumho Tire succeeded
in completing its workout program in 2014 through improvements in financial structure and credit
grading, thus paving the way for new growth. Over the past five years, Kumho Tire has improved an
ineffective cost structure to transform into a company with higher operating profit, reducing its debt
ratio from 858% in 2011 to 262% at the end of 2014. As a result, the company moved into a more
financially stable position. In addition, Kumho Tire forged a technological alliance with Yokohama
Rubber Corporation, Japan to enable another takeoff and prepared for future growth by resuming
the construction of a new plant in the United States.
As a member of the Kumho Asiana Group, Kumho Tire strives to become a trusted corporation
by acting on pledges based on irreproachable business practices, and a respected corporation
by fulfilling its social responsibilities and contributing to society. In particular, fully aware of the
importance of social responsibility for sustainable development, this report by Kumho Tire contains
information on how it actively deals with labor and management issues, marketing communication
with customers, and the environmental impact of tires, aspects which are crucial to the company.
With such efforts, Kumho Tire constantly strives to be a corporation with a high reputation for
producing strong, powerful, and stylish tires.
Overcoming some challenging hardships, Kumho Tires is committed to making strenuous efforts to
renew itself as a global tire company.
I look forward to all stakeholders' continued interest in and support for Kumho Tire's new takeoff.
Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,Kyobo Life Insurance,1,Korea,"2012 has been a year where there has been continuous global economic downturn due to the European Financial Crisis, which also
caused Korea's symptoms of prolonged low economic growth and low interest rates. In response to this, financial authorities have
strengthened policies regarding standards of financial soundness and risk management for financial companies. Despite these uncertainties
through Kyobo Life's new business policy of 'Customer Assurance Innovation, Strengthening Profit Creation', we have
maximized our efforts to reach our 'Vision 2015' of 'being the best company in customer assurance'.Through our two previous sustainability management reports and our philosophy of co-development with all of our stakeholders,
we have promised you four things. Kyobo Life has striven to fulfill these pledge in our last business year, and we shall keep doing so
in the future.
In order to address our first pledge of always giving utmost priority to customer service, we have accelerated our 'Life Long Care
Project' which was first launched in June 2011. As a part of this effort, the 'Life Long Care Project Services' designed for advanced
customer assurance has been revised to better fit customer expectations. To minimize customer dissatisfaction we have steadily
made efforts to establish a full-underwriting process culture, and we have opened a 'VOC Management' department to more effectively
listen to customers and reflect it to our activities to improve our products and services.
To address our second pledge of growing together with its financial planners and employees, we have opened seminars that share
the company's annual business operations as well as future outlooks with our employees. Through the seminars we also had
chances to communicate with the mentioned personnel through direct participation from the Board of Directors. We have also
strengthened our insurance marketing education, and activated our intra-company job circulation program to expand employee
opportunities to grow.
Our third pledge of continuing to be an attractive investment to investors is being realized through our continuous investment and
thorough risk management in growing markets(B2B2C, emerging areas, the upper class). Given the recent low interest rate and
low development phenomena we have increased our investment in long-term bonds to secure steady profits, as well as increased
investment in high-interest rate assets within manageable risk areas to enhance profitability.
The fourth pledge of progressing together with the government and community is being realized through persistent social contribution
activities. 2012 was a special case where 'Kyobo Dasomi', our volunteering organization comprising our financial planners,
executive, and staff members celebrated its 10th year of establishment, which gave further meaning to Kyobo Life's cause of social
contribution. We will further concentrate our efforts toward local communities that need us and areas of public interest that are
relevant to our industry's characteristics.
In 2012, Kyobo Life has been granted much social acknowledgment and support through its diligent sustainability management.
In the sustainability management competition sponsored by the KSA which is under the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, we have
been named first place for three consecutive years among all life insurance companies in the country. Other recent performances
are receiving the grand prize in the area of life insurance in 'Financial Customer Protection', being nominated to be the best company
in 'Labor and Management Culture' sponsored by the Ministry of Employment and Labor', receiving the grand prize as the 'Best
Asian Insurance Manager'. However, Kyobo Life will not let it go to our heads and will further put in our best efforts to better realize
our pledge for our stakeholders. As a member of the UN Global Compact which provides its 10 principles involving human rights,
labor, environment, and anti-corruption, Kyobo Life would like to express our enduring support. We are trying in diverse ways to
apply the mentioned Principles in our decision-making processes.
The recent economic difficulties in both domestic and foreign settings is said to be likely to continue for the next few years. It is predicted
that this will cause the insurance industry to shrink and increase the amount of risk involved, having a negative effect in the
insurance business as a whole. But Kyobo Life's determination and efforts to realize sustainability management and fulfill our social
responsibility at all costs will act as a solid foundation to overcome such crises.
We thank the stakeholders for your support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,Kyobo Life Insurance,2,Korea,"Greetings to the respected stakeholders! 2013 has been a year in which the Korean Economy highly dependent on export and import experienced many difficulties caused by domestic and overseas events, , such as the reduced consumer spending, lukewarm growth of employment rate, and a decrease in corporate investment, due to the prolonged international recession. Despite these difficulties, Kyobo Life strived to accomplish its business policy of ¡°innovation of insurance coverage to customers and advancement of profit generation¡± through the hard work of all its employees. We focused on achieving our long-term goal of becoming the company that ¡°provides the best insurance coverage to customers¡± by 2015. As a result, Kyobo Life became more competent in creating profit and maintaining financial soundness and subsequently earning greater level of trust from you. I am deeply grateful for our stakeholders¡¯ unfailing trust and faith in Kyobo Life and give them all the credit for allowing us to achieve what we have until today. Kyobo Life values human life and believes that their values should be respected and realized. In this respect, Kyobo Life is presenting its fourth edition of the Sustainability Management Report titled, the ¡°People and Future.¡± This is to put in practice the basic process of listening to the stakeholders, focusing on their needs, delivering the pledges we made every year after listening and focusing with our utmost sincerity and sharing the results and progresses with all of you, the stakeholders. Pledge: We will become a company that is good at providing insurance coverage to customers. The continued promotion of the ¡°Lifelong Care Project¡± started in 2011 to boost our competitiveness in providing insurance coverage to customers improved the quality of our insurance service, throughout all processes, including subscription, persistency, and payment, resulting in earning a higher grade in the customer complaint evaluation by the Financial Supervisory Service. This grade, however, is still not as high as we wish it to be: we will work harder to listen to the various opinions of customers and swiftly apply them to our service policies. Pledge: We will become a company that succeeds together with its Financial Planners. We accepted the requests of Financial Planners aspiring to become the expert in providing insurance coverage to customers and built training centers that offer programs that will help them develop the ability to design insurance coverage and sell and service the insurance policies. In addition, I, the CEO, myself frequently visited the fields of sales service and gathered their suggestions for improvements for better communication, to provide a greater opportunity to the Financial Planners and support their development into the experts. Pledge: We will become a company that grows together with its employees. We endeavored to cherish our human resources and build a company where employees are rewarded according to their performance and supported for their growth, so that they would enjoy working for the company. To this end, we strengthened our training on the marketing of insurance to help employees better understand the life insurance business, and promoted the rotation and expansion of positions to provide greater opportunity for the employees to develop their careers. Pledge: We will become a company that is attractive to investors. Kyobo Life has consistently increased its investment in long-term bonds in anticipation of prolonged low interest rates and focused on securing a steady flow of profit by increasing investment in high-yield assets within the limit of manageable risk. As a result, Kyobo Life earned an A+ rating from Fitch Ratings, one of the three major international credit rating agencies. Kyobo Life has also maintained a rating of A2 for six consecutive years from Moody¡¯s and the AAA rating, the highest rating by NICE Rating, a Korean credit rating agency, for seven consecutive years. We will maintain the momentum of growth supported by a healthy profitability, by securing new growth engines and more precise risk management. Pledge: We will become a company that grows together with the government and communities. In order to materialize the sprit of neighborly love inherent in the insurance business, we labored to practice the wisdom of coexistence, focusing on social contribution activities to help the less fortunate to overcome the difficulties caused by illnesses, financial hardship and lack of education. We will strengthen our partnership with expert and transparent nonprofit organizations and promote with them the projects that local communities need and at which Kyobo Life can excel. Kyobo life¡¯s diligent work over the past year received much recognition, earning the top place among all life insurance companies for four consecutive years in the Korean Sustainability Management Competition sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy and Korean Standards Association. We were also awarded the 2013 Consumer Grand Award from the Korean Society of Consumer Studies and recognized as the best family-friendly corporation. These accomplishments encourage us to faithfully and continually honor our pledges with stakeholders and push ourselves to a higher standard. Additionally, Kyobo Life would like to express its enduring support of the 10 Principles involving human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, suggested by the UN Global Compact, as a member of the Compact. The volatility of the global economy has risen higer than ever since the global economic crisis. Especially in the life insurance business, the negative spread due to prolonged low interest rate will have a negative impact for the next several years. Kyobo life, however, is determined to keep its business policy of growing together with all stakeholders under any circumstances, in pursuit of sustainable development. We will continue our journey to becoming ¡°an admired company that will thrive for hundreds of years to come¡± with the help of all stakeholders. Thank you.
Chang-Jae Shin, CEO & Chairman

538,Kyobo Life Insurance,4,Korea,"Greetings, Dear Stakeholders!
On behalf of Kyobo Life, I would like to express our gratitude for your
unwavering support.
In 2015, the Korean economy was hit by both domestic and international
challenges, including the MERS outbreak, depressed domestic
demand, and the U.S. interest rate hike, all of which occurred simultaneously.
However, despite such a challenging management environment,
Kyobo Life has successfully carried out its management directive
? ¡®expansion of insurance coverage¡¯ and ¡®improvement in profit
structure,¡¯ and concluded its Vision2015 to become a company that
provides ¡®optimum insurance coverage and on-going services.¡¯
Kyobo Life¡¯s journey for the achievement of Vision2015, starting in
2011, was significant, and led to much acclaim and even recognition
by awards. Consequently, Kyobo Life received the Consumer Grand
Prize Award in 2013 and the Most Loved Companies President¡¯s
Commendation in 2014. In February of 2016, in recognition of our
accomplishments in management transparency, management-labor
stability, and social contributions, the Grand Prize Award in the 12th
Management Transparency Awards was also bestowed upon Kyobo Life.
In the belief that all humans are precious beings and their values
should be respected and realized, we have published our sixth Sustainability
Report entitled ¡®Humanity and the Future.¡¯ This is intended
to share the fruits of our endeavors in fulfilling the pledges of mutual
growth with stakeholders, as well as reminding ourselves of the significance
of those pledges.
Our pledges to our Stakeholders and the Results in 2015 are as follows:
We will become a company that provides
optimum insurance coverage and on-going services.
We have differentiated the quality of our ¡®Lifelong Care Service¡¯ by providing
¡®customized services¡¯ that enable us to offer products best suited
to our customers¡¯ needs in the most effective ways. These services
reflect a life insurance culture that emphasizes ¡®policy persistency¡¯ for
insurance coverage over ¡®new subscriptions.¡¯ Also, we have improved
our work processes from the customers¡¯ perspective by strengthening
and expanding our proactive measures to VOC and customer com-plaints, and also by reflecting various customer opinions in our insurance
marketing strategies, rules, and policies.
We will become a company
that succeeds together with our Financial Planners.
We have revamped our training support system for Financial Planners
based on their experiences and feedback. We improved our training
program for new Financial Planners with less than 12 months of experience,
in order to help them develop as professionals capable of consulting
for insurance coverage and executing ¡®Lifelong Care Service.¡¯
We have also expanded our training program and support system for
existing Financial Planners with more than 13 months of experience. In
order to improve Financial Planner-ship faithful to the basic principles
of life insurance, and to strengthen the morale and motivation for their
daily work, we hosted ¡®Kyobo MDRT Day.¡¯
We will become a company
that grows together with our employees.
Kyobo Life strove to become the ¡®most desirable company to work for¡¯
by securing great talent and creating a corporate culture that supports
growth and offers performance-based rewards. In order to cultivate an
advanced insurance business culture, we sponsored a number of our
sales managers to attend the MDRT Annual Meeting and the MDRT
Experience Meeting held in Hong Kong. In addition, through our quarterly
Labor-Management Council we actively communicate with the
labor union that represents our employees.
We will become a company that is attractive to investors.
In order to become a company that shows sustainable growth, we
have to maintain stable financial soundness in the long run, while continuing
to improve our profitability even under a challenging management
environment. We improved our liability structure, enhanced
asset management returns, and strengthened our risk management in
preparation for reinforced financial soundness regulations. In addition,
we are also preparing proactive measures for impending changes in
the management environment, such as the upcoming implementation
of IFRS4 Phase II. As a result of these efforts, our favorable profitability,
solid capital adequacy, and our excellent business profile,
Kyobo Life has been recognized with an ¡®A1¡¯ rating by Moody¡¯s, a
world-renowned credit ratings agency. Kyobo Life is the first company
in the life insurance industry to receive this rating.
We will become a company
that grows together with the government and communities.
Communities are where we continue to grow and develop, and the
basis on which we fulfill our role as members of society. Kyobo Life
contributes to the development of communities through partnerships
with non-profit organizations that are professional and transparent,
focusing on social contributions activities related to life insurance
business. We also engage in various social contribution projects for
communities by continuing to provide funds for the Kyobo Foundation
for Education which supports youth education and scholarship
programs, the Daesan Agriculture Foundation which provides support
for rural development, and the Daesan Foundation which supports
the development of Korean literature.
We would also like to express our enduring support for the ten principles
of the UN Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labor,
the environment, and anti-corruption. As a participating member, we
will continue to embrace, support, and enact these ten fundamental
principles in our sphere of management.
In January 2016, Kyobo Life announced its brand new Vision2020 to become
¡®Korea¡¯s most innovative life insurance company in product and
distribution¡¯?a clear and daring goal that requires the attention of our
every capacity through 2020, and represents a new beginning with the
mission of helping everyone confidently pursue their dearest dreams
throughout their lives, overcoming every adversity by mutual support.
We ask for your continued support and interest in our bold journey
toward a new vision.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,LG Chem,1,Korea,"Last year, LG Chem achieved KRW 23.263 trillion of sales and KRW 1.910 trillion of
operating income on a consolidated basis. Although sales increased 3% compared to
2011, operating income reflected itself in overall slow business performance stemming
from the lack of demand because of the global economic recession and the decline
in product prices. Although business performance was weak, all our executives and
employees strengthened core capabilities of the key businesses and proceeded to
make future preparations based on our management system which assigns more
responsibilities to the mangement of each business unit.
In the area of petrochemicals, we concentrated on nurturing high value-added
technology-based key businesses like SSBR, SAP and metallocene PE to respond
to decreasing revenues due to the deteriorating market situation, and implemented
global expansion of key business like the complex project in Kazakhstan. In the IT &
electronic materials sector, we maintained global No.1 status in the polarizer business
and enhanced profitability by expanding our share of high value-added businesses
like 3D Film Patterned Retarder (FPR). In addition, the company made new business
investments in LCD glass substrates, touch panels and ITO films and put plants in
operation. As for the battery business area, we reinforced our business competitiveness
by pursuing low-priced material development, high-performance and differentiated
product development, and established a basis for creating future revenue by winning
additional orders from major automotive companies. We have been also working on
making preparations for the future with our successful entrance into the Energy Storage
System (ESS) battery market.
At LG Chem, we acknowledge that we should pay attention not only to economic
performance but also to environmental and social performance in order to achieve
sustainable and sound growth. Environmental issues, such as
eco-friendly products, harmful chemical substances, climate
change, energy, resources and environment pollution, and
social issues, such as safety, human rights protection and
human resources development, anti-corruption, fair trade
and shared growth and social contribution actually have a
great impact on the current business activities of LG Chem.
Our strategic and systematic approach to the various issues
surrounding sustainability involves exploring the principles of
sustainable management and the strategic direction to follow
as well as the selection of implementation plans that allow us
to deal with these issues in a stepwise fashion. In particular,
we are working on integrating social responsibility into all
levels of management to meet the social expectations and
needs of stakeholders, based on strategies of strengthening
CSR that has been implemented at the group level.
Our key performances of sustainability management in 2012
include completing pilot construction for pioneering the ecofriendly
plastics market; constantly being engaged in R&D and
producing good results in a variety of areas like rechargeable
battery materials, which is based on platform technologies like
precision coating technology, touch panel materials and solar
cell materials; researching and investing in organic solar cells;
launching high value-added products like 3D FPR; continuously
investing in LCD glass substrates and battery materials; and
discovering new items in the green energy sector like solar cell
materials and OLED lighting.
Moreover, the company has seen good results in terms of the
environment and society, such as doing a comprehensive
checkup and improvement of our company-wide environment
& safety management system, supplementing and expanding
our chemical management system, establishing an ITbased
energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission
management system suitable for both Korea and China,
reducing our greenhouse gas production by 240 thousand
tons, expanding global human resources recruitment, and
reinforcing LG Chem¡¯s capacity-based social contribution
activities, especially in the area of youth education.
This report includes our activities and outcomes over the
last year in an attempt to share with stakeholders how LG
Chem grows and contributes to development of the economy,
environment and society. In particular, this report covers
manufacturing sites, not only those in Korea but also those in
China, thereby enhancing the integrity of information that the
sustainability management reporting of LG Chem should be
able to produce. In addition, we hope that this report raises the
understanding of information presented here by connecting
the overall strategic system of sustainability management of
LG Chem with the organization of the report.
This year, the business environment is again expected to
be very difficult. However, LG Chem will continuously strive
to create outstanding economic performance and lead the
market by dealing with environmental changes more swiftly
and providing differentiated customer value faster than our
competitors. Also, we will stay committed to enriching human
life and taking responsiblity as the best ¡®Solution Partner¡¯
which helps customers to bring about good outcomes, and
grow as a trusty and respected global chemical company by
taking and practicing our social responsibility. I would like to
ask for your continuous support and encouragement.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,LG Chem,2,Korea,"LG Chem achieved KRW 23.1 trillion in sales and KRW 1.7 trillion in operating income last year in the midst of the slowing
economic growth in emerging countries and depression in demand due to the delayed global economic recovery.
Given such difficult conditions, our performance can be considered relatively satisfactory, and further, we continuously
strengthened our core competence and competitiveness to gain market leadership in each business domain.
In 2014, the business environment is again expected to be challenging as it was last year. However, with strong
determination and passion to lead the market, all executives and employees of LG Chem will make the utmost effort
to achieve outstanding results. By securing differentiated competitiveness in existing businesses and advanced technologies
and impeccable quality in new businesses, LG Chem will grow into a global leading company.
Global Chemical Company with Sales of over KRW 30 trillion by 2017
LG Chem will grow into a global chemical company with sales of over KRW 30 trillion by 2017. To that end, we have
established the following series of management tasks: ¢º a global material company with strong R&D capabilities ¢º
a workplace where talent can follow their dreams ¢º a responsible company that co-exists with society, and we will
conduct a variety of activities to accomplish these tasks.
Best 'Solution Partner' that Contributes to Resolving Environmental and Social
Issues with its Innovative Materials and Solutions
By figuring out the demands of various stakeholders on the pending environmental and social issues one step ahead
and providing materials and solutions helpful to resolve those issues, LG Chem will emerge as a responsible company
that co-exists and grows with society.
Responsible Company that Co-exists with Society
To accomplish one of our management tasks, ¡®a responsible company that co-exists with society,¡¯ we restructured our
CSR organization in September 2013. CSR Team was newly formed to integrate internal and external communication
channels, carefully listening to the voices of diverse stakeholders and planning and executing specific activities.
In addition, we joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in March 2014 to fulfill our responsibility as a global
corporate citizen. LG Chem will strengthen its efforts to voluntarily comply with the 10 principles in 4 categories of
human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption in its business activity at home and abroad.
This Sustainability Report, which is the 8th edition, mainly deals with the issues that stakeholders consider to be
significant, and that have been thoroughly discussed over the last year in the aspects of economy, environment and
society. In addition, this report covers manufacturing sites not only in Korea but also in China when it comes to the
performance of CSR activities.
LG Chem will lay the foundation for sustainable and sound growth by pursuing active interaction and substantial
growth with various stakeholders, and thus emerge as a well-respected and market-leading global chemical company.
I would like to ask for your continuous support and encouragement.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,LG Chem,3,Korea,"We would like to express our deepest gratitude for your continued support for LG Chem. Last year, even in the midst of tough business environment
with sluggish demand, resulting from the slow global economic recovery, and declining product prices, from intensifying competition,
LG Chem made notable achievements towards market leadership by solidifying our technical and business leadership in each business area.
We strengthened our competitiveness in the basic materials and chemicals business including EP; expanded the global customer base in the
technology-based business such as SAP and SSBR; developed the world¡¯s first 100 lm/w OLED panel; and signed the supply contracts on automotive
batteries with global automakers based on the world¡¯s top competitiveness.
We will build the foundation and competitiveness for sustainable growth.
This year is expected to be another year of slow global economic growth, and tough business environment will persist. However, LG Chem intends
to overcome these difficulties by setting our sight on ¡°market leadership,¡± taking on challenges and executing in a decisive manner. We
will maximize the value of our existing businesses and intensively nurture future growth engines while also making forays into new materials
businesses, and ultimately build the foundation and competitiveness to achieve sustainable growth.
We will become a global materials company that grows along with society.
Growing along with society is vital to a company¡¯s sustainable growth. As a global materials company that supplies materials essential to
modern society, LG Chem intends to contribute to resolving social and environmental issues facing us by striving to develop innovative technologies
and products. We focus on developing materials that enhance the environmental friendliness of products and developing highly efficient
products that consume less energy. We are also leading the growth of the green energy solutions market with our automotive batteries
and energy storage systems. LG Chem will become a company that continuously grows along with society by identifying the needs of society
one step ahead, providing innovative solutions that exceed expectations, and thereby creating new values.
We will always adhere to the fundamentals and principles.
LG Chem will create a culture where the fundamentals, standards and principles which should never be forgotten during the course of growth
are always adhered to. By putting safety and the environment first across all business operations, we will continuously monitor and make
improvements to ensure that our employees, business partners and local communities of all global operations can live in a safe and clean
environment. In addition, based on Jeong-Do Management, LG¡¯s own code of conduct, we will root out corruption and unethical practices
and create a fair trading culture. Based on the belief that our responsibility towards society is to share growth with our business partners and
contribute to a balanced economic growth, we will create a virtuous cycle in which our growth becomes a cornerstone for business partners¡¯
growth and turn business partners¡¯ capabilities into our own capabilities.
In 2014 Sustainability Report of LG Chem, which is the ninth report, we included the activities and efforts on how we tried to build sustainable
competitiveness and grow along with society in the past year. The report, in particular, covers the activities of all of its global operations in Europe,
U.S., and other Asian regions in addition to Korea and China with an aim to communicate to stakeholders our responsibility as a global
company conducting business worldwide.
LG Chem acknowledges that creating sustainable and sound performances is more important than focusing on short-term results. We, therefore,
will continue to implement a systematic management of a variety of issues in social and environmental aspects which have mutual influences

Dear Stakeholders, I would like to express my deep appreciation for your constant care and support for LG Chem. Last year, LG Chem increased operation profits successfully and drastically, improving the product spread, saving prime costs company-wide, and establishing differentiated product portfolios despite challenging situations such as global economic recession and low oil prices. In the area of basic materials, LG Chem has secured the world highest energy efficiency in NCC and maintained high profitability by strengthening the cost-competitive capacity in basic petrochemical. In the area of IT and electronics materials as well, LG Chem has developed the local production system in China further, maximizing the profitability of polarizing plate products.

In the area of energy solutions, we have secured major customers in the global market by developing the market-leading automotive/ESS battery products. The business of mobile batteries is expanding for emerging markets such as the rapidly growing small EV market. This year, the business management environment is more uncertain than previous years due to various risks such as prolonged periods of low growth and low oil prices, unstable conditions of global financial markets, and so forth. As the rate of self-sufficiency of petrochemical products in China increases, emerging companies equipped with innovative technologies are ever more threatening. Competitors are strengthening their competitiveness by seeking consistent changes such as restructuring and new business promotion.
Despite such challenging circumstances, LG Chem will continue overcoming threats and strengthening the foundation for sustainable growth through the future-oriented, proactive changes and organizational culture that sticks to the  asics. ¡°We will continue establishing future-oriented business portfolios.¡± There is an old saying, ¡°Cho-mok-ji-si (õ®ÙÊò±ãÁ),¡± which means to look ahead into the future and prepare yourself thoroughly.

by making changes proactively. We will grasp the flow of social ¡¤ environmental mega trends and actively establish future-oriented business portfolios. Particularly, LG Chem will focus on energy, water, and bio areas with great potentials for growth specifically in such businesses as electric vehicle batteries, water treatment RO membranes, green bio business, etc. ¡°We will continue developing products that create new values essential for mankind.¡± LG Chem will grasp changes in the world and among customers, focusing on providing values that customers desire to have. By securing differentiated competitive edges in terms of technologies, commodities, and prices, we will create customer values and develop products necessary for the life of mankind based on differentiated technologies. In addition, LG Chem also will take the lead of the eco-friendly energy solution market with its high energy efficiency materials and products especially in the automotive/ESS battery business. ¡°We will secure sustainable competitiveness based on the organizational culture that sticks to the basics.¡± In this time of high uncertainty, it is essential to be ever more faithful to the basics than before in order to overcome the challenging business management environment and continue developing corporate competitiveness. LG Chem will fulfill its social responsibilities as a global enterprise by complying with principles and regulations throughout the business operation process from raw material purchase to product development, manufacturing, and sales. With safety and environment as the top priority in every business activity, we will achieve the ¡®Zero Accident¡¯ goal.

102,LG Display,1,Korea,"I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the stakeholders who have shown their interest and provided
support and encouragement for LG Display to become the No. 1 global business.
Due to the lasting consequences of the global economic depression and excess supply in the display industry, 2012 was expected to
be a challenging year. Nonetheless, LG Display proclaimed the idea of ¡®You Dream, We Display,¡¯ a new vision to be a future turning point,
as a way to turn this crisis into an opportunity and realize changes and leaps through various innovative activities.
We have devoted efforts to secure high profitability through manufacturing high value-added products using differentiated technology,
such as IPS and FPR 3D for smart devices, while leading the OLED display market based on the advanced OLED technical competence.
As a result, we realized the monumental achievement of cumulative production of 1 billion large LCD modules in last September
for the first time in the industry. Through such endeavor and achievement, we achieved the highest quarter sales for three consecutive
quarters and accomplished the goal of becoming the ¡®Global No. 1¡¯ in the display market.
Such accomplishments by LG Display are the outcome of 'mutual growth' that has been sincerely promoted by our 'mutual growth
management'. LG Display has supported and funded construction of infrastructure for partners while actively sponsoring capability reinforcement
by providing expanded educational opportunities to the employees of partner companies. Especially, ¡®the benefit sharing
system¡¯ has been implemented for the partners to grow as world-class suppliers. Moreover, in recognition of the efforts exerted toward
mutual growth management, LG Display was appointed in 2012 as ¡®a business that practiced CSR for mutual growth.¡¯
Meanwhile, LG Display is endeavoring to fulfill its social responsibility and roles as a corporate citizen that deserves the title of a global
No.1 company. Various CSR activities including IT power plant project are promoted with NGOs to expand the educational opportunities
for teenagers who are in challenging situation. The labor union is also actively participating in USR activities (Union Social Responsibility)
by supporting scholarships to the children of fire officers and policemen who died in line of duty. Moreover, LG Display established
¡®Nanumnuri¡¯ , an affiliate designed for the physically challenged, in April for the first time in the industry, and the institution has
been operated to expand employment and independence of the physically challenged. From the environmental perspective, Green
Management System was established to provide green consulting and incentive as part of the efforts to realize green growth together
with the partners.
Dear stakeholders.
The faith and support you have given for the past year have been the great strength for LG Display to overcome the challenging market
situation and prepare for a new leap. We expect various difficulties this year as well; however, we promise to exert our utmost efforts
to live up to your expectations.
Thank you very much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

105,LG Electronics,1,Korea,"What is the philosophy behind LG Electronics¡¯ sustainability management?
For a company, sustainability management starts with building competitiveness in its core businesses.
To become a truly sustainable company, we need to focus all of our capabilities on understanding the needs
of our customers and providing differentiated products and services based on our technology and product
leadership.
Everything we do ? from actively engaging in marketing initiatives that produce results to creating a nurturing
environment that helps our employees apply their capabilities to the fullest ? is driven by LG¡¯s unique
management philosophy of ""Customer Value Creation"" and ""People-Oriented Management."" I believe that
our conviction to remain true to such values is the key driving force behind the sustainable growth of LG
Electronics.
What are the key sustainability management initiatives of LG Electronics for this year?
Presently, growing uncertainties in the global marketplace and increasing customer expectations are creating
an unfavorable business climate and much pessimism about the possibility of growth. Since its establishment,
LG Electronics has never stopped striving to strengthen its fundamentals. As a result, our product leadership,
which is a key prerequisite for being a market leader, continues to improve and our fundamentals are
becoming stronger across the entire organization.
This year we will apply everything that we have accomplished so far to lead the market with differentiated
products and services that only LG Electronics can deliver. To this end, we must secure ¡°differentiated product
leadership¡± by fully aligning our thoughts and actions with the market and customers, constantly generating
new ideas and swiftly putting great ideas into practice with a keen focus on producing meaningful results.
Moreover, it is imperative that we transform our work and management style to be fully aligned with
our customers' needs. To this end, we must constantly question ourselves as to whether we are simply
going through the motions and not seeing what customers truly need and make the transformation into a
¡°customercentric¡± organization.
Going forward, what direction is LG Electronics planning to take to achieve sustainability management?
We will guarantee that LG Electronics never compromises its fundamentals, which have been developed over
time based on our strong convictions. Not only will we remain true to the roots of our business, we will also
strive to further strengthen our fundamentals by complying with the laws of the land as a responsible corporate
citizen and adhering to our unique guiding principles, what we call ¡°Jeong-Do Management.¡±
Employees of LG Electronics should never compromise themselves under any circumstances and compete in
the market fairly. I am convinced that we can ensure the sustainable growth of the company and gain more
opportunities to contribute to society by continuing on this path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

107,LG Electronics,3,Korea,"What do you think is the most important for sustainability management at LG Electronics?
In a rapidly changing business environment, we cannot afford to remain still; we have to constantly think about
ways to achieve growth and advance our businesses. At the same time, we have to always remember that our
customers are the absolute and enduring standard that drives our thinking, inspires our actions, and pushes us
forward, as we focus on creating positive impact on the world. Throughout this process, we always take ¡°Jeong-do
Management¡± as our guiding principle, because strict compliance with the law and standards is both the starting
point and ultimate goal of our efforts to become a truly global corporation.
Please tell us about LG Electronics¡¯ achievements in sustainability management in 2014.
In 2014, we made organization-wide efforts to build and strengthen fundamentals, the very foundation
for sustainable and enduring growth. As a result, the strength of our organization is improving, and we are
thoroughly preparing to secure opportunities in our future businesses. In addition, both our employees and
management are carefully identifying actions and practices required for sustainable management and putting
them into practice. We are also defining practices that we need to adopt in conducting business, while directing
our interest and energy towards issues that affect both individuals and societies to fulfill our responsibility as a
corporate citizen. I am convinced that all of these efforts will come together and help us establish sustainability
management as our core strength.
What is the direction of LG Electronics¡¯ sustainability management?
I strongly believe that first and foremost, corporations must focus on the primary purpose of doing business in
order to contribute to society as well as to achieve sustained growth. To this end, it is important for corporations
to identify changes both in customers and global trends, to think and prepare in advance, and to execute
measures that respond to these changes in a careful and thorough manner. The business landscape around us
is shifting constantly and becoming more complex with diverse and intertwined interests creating uncertainties.
In order to overcome such challenges and achieve growth, we need to draw on strengths not only from within
our organization but also from the outside world, creating synergy greater than the simple sum of our own
strengths. In order to further strengthen our capabilities for sustainable management, LG Electronics will actively
engage with stakeholders for their valuable opinions, while sharing our market intelligence and customer insight
obtained directly from the frontline of business operations.

achieving goals is a cause for celebration, our vow to become a company that continuously creates exceptional customer
value is a finish line we strive to keep on moving further.
Forecasts of tremendous market shifts, (related to the governmental real estate policy), along with the delayed recovery
of the domestic construction industry, project 2014 to be a challenging year. In anticipation of the road ahead, LG Hausys
will differentiate its business model by expanding its line of energy-efficient and eco-friendly products. Meanwhile, customer
contact points will be diversified through the sustained innovation of retail channels.
Due to the diversifying structure of touch screen applications in the IT market, the demand for varied adhesive materials
is expected to rise. Likewise, automobile markets (predominantly in North America and China), are set for continued
growth. To further tap and secure these markets, we will ensure our lead in cost advantage and product differentiation,
while fortifying our sales and production bases in the emerging markets of the U.S. and China.
While anticipating the ebb and flow of domestic and world markets is an instrumental pillar of corporate success, so is
the ability to deliver an excellent product. That is why we at LG Hausys continue to make pre-emptive R&D investments
and secure a solid R&D workforce in anticipation of future market demands. This not only allows us to transform our existing
operations into market-leading businesses, but also gives us the opportunity to identify new growth engines across
the board.LG Hausys envisions to ¡®Create Human-Friendly, Eco-Conscious Living Spaces¡¯. We help fashion flourishing living spaces
and create value for our customers. In this process, LG Hausys is there every step of the way?from manufacturing, marketing,
sales and distribution to R&D. To this end, each one of our employees is committed to spearheading the market in
delivering human-friendly, eco-conscious and energy-saving products.
To make real the tenets of our corporate vision, LG Hausys undertakes a number of practical sustainability management
initiatives.
First, we set green management goals and GHG reduction plans and take action accordingly.
In 2013 alone, our endeavors to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions - through the recovery of more waste
heat and condensates, facility efficiency gains and stronger management activities - allowed us to save 9,321 tons in CO2
emissions.
Second, we pioneer the industry in producing human-friendly, eco-conscious products.
To extend the scope of our domestically and internationally certified products, we use natural materials and recycled resources,
in addition to developing energy-saving products (eco-labeling, Healthy Building mark, etc.). Moreover, LG Hausys
is the first in the industry to introduce a carbon labeling scheme and fully engage in the governmental low-carbon green
consumption policy as a certified company.
Third, we take earnest responsibility to preserve the environment and contribute to community development.
Our Dokdo Nature Preservation Zone ¡®Jikimi (keepers)¡¯ initiative, launched in 2008, has made great inroads into protecting
the Dokdo area. One of our highlighted community development programs is our ¡®Make a Happy Space¡¯ initiative.
This program targets public facilities for teenagers and local children¡¯s centers, where we¡¯re operating a myriad of socialgiving
programs for youth education and environmental protection.
Fourth, we ensure that the safety and environmental management systems we have in place protect the welfare
our employees, our communities and the environment.
Our current management system is certified with the Green Company Program from the Ministry of Environment, ISO
14001 (environmental management), KOSHA 18001 (health and safety management) and OHSAS 18001. Furthermore, we
are ever seeking to further perfect our accountability by establishing company-wide safety and environmental management
targets.
Fifth, all LG Hausys employees live by the ¡®Jeong-Do¡¯ management principle, which aims to produce substantial
outcomes from ethical, competency-based and fair business practices.
To ensure that each employee is on the same page with the tenets of this principle, the ¡®Jeong-Do¡¯ management philosophy
is highlighted in our Business Partner Management Guideline.
Sixth, LG Hausys pursues mutually-beneficial partnerships with its suppliers. We work hand-in-hand with our suppliers
to develop technology and create patent applications. Through professional/financial support and continued
sustained communications with the top management of respective suppliers, our suppliers gain a clear capacitybuilding
advantage.
To position ourselves as a true market-leading company, we vow to supply our customers with safe, eco-friendly products/
materials and energy-efficient systems and solutions. Moreover, we will cherish and further strive to win the trust
and respect of our customers in our journey as a global company that sincerely complies with social responsibility. Your
continued interest in and support for LG Hausys is, as always, greatly appreciated.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,LG Hausys,3,Korea,"I am very pleased to present the 2015 LG Hausys Sustainability Report to our stakeholders.
LG Hausys published its first sustainability report in 2012. In this, our fourth sustainability report, as in our previous
offerings, we share with our valued stakeholders our activities and achievements in economic, environmental,
and social areas. This year¡¯s sustainability report is the outcome of our earnest efforts to respond to issues our
stakeholders deemed as having particular importance in 2014, covering such areas as global markets, research and
development, eco-friendly products, customer communication, and local community development.
Committed to creating ¡°human-friendly, eco-conscious living spaces,¡± LG Hausys is a leading supplier of environmentfriendly
and energy-efficient materials and products and a trendsetter in future-oriented living spaces. Armed with
technological prowess and outstanding design competence, LG Hausys will continue to spearhead the trends our
competitors follow and provide our customers with the highest level of satisfaction.
Despite fiercer competition in the construction materials market and the slowdown of the IT market, LG Hausys still
made great strides in sales and profitability in 2014, realizing KRW 2.8251 trillion in sales and KRW 146.6 billion in
operating profits. Such achievements we attribute to the ambitious reforms we carried out in the areas of cost, sales,
and products.
While it is certainly nice to look back, it should not get in the way of looking ahead. LG Hausys has been proactively
making plans for the future which include nurturing market-leading businesses, seeking out new growth engines,
expanding investment in R&D and in efforts to recruit research talents, and augmenting our presence in overseas
markets.Far from resting on its laurels, LG Hausys will continue to make every effort to create value for customers.
First, we will expand our global presence.
LG Hausys operates seven overseas companies and five overseas branches, and we are continually striving to enter
new markets around the world. We introduce localized products and focus on supplying eco-friendly products in
response to global environmental regulations. In 2014, we joined international fairs that were held in diverse regions,
including Shanghai, Dubai, Kazakhstan, Germany, and Singapore, to name only a few, to spur greater recognition of
the LG Hausys brand.
Second, we will push our capacity for product research, development and design even further.
LG Hausys is developing various functional products geared toward solving common everyday problems, such as
noise between apartment floors and fires, through seeking out organic cooperation between each project sector
and research institutions. We are also sharpening our design competencies, evidence of which is found in the many
prestigious design awards we have won over the years, including Red Dot and iF. Our innovative and consumercentric
design management is what sets us apart from the competition. Our collaborations with guest designers,
renowned in their field, have resulted in great outcomes, and our design trend seminars have enabled us to keep
abreast of all the latest developments in design. We will continue to engage in active R&D activities and introduce
new designs that reflect the demands of consumers in every area in which we do business.
Third, we are increasing our green product lineups.
LG Hausys established its ¡°Green Identity¡± in order to develop humanistic, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient
products. Notably, we are the first Korean flooring supplier to receive Cradle to Cradle (C2C) certification. As well
our automotive skins, ZEA wallpaper, and ZEA flooring have received Oeko-tex Standard 100 Grade 1 (Baby class)
certification, only given to those products safe enough to be exposed to babies and toddlers up to 3 years old. We
are determined to continue producing green products that benefit the health and well-being of our customers.
Fourth, we pursue open communication with our customers.
LG Hausys strives to make its products more readily accessible to customers through opening on and offline
showrooms. In 2014 we opened Gangnam Z:IN Square along with nine other new showrooms and the online
shopping mall ¡°Z:IN Mall.¡± The female prosumer group, ¡°Z:ENNE,¡± and SNS channels and communities have given us
active, direct paths to customers, enabling us to reflect their voices in product development.
Last, we are committed to improving the lives of all people.
LG Hausys actively engages in a number of CSR activities, such as the ¡°Make a Happy Space¡± initiative, the ¡°Happy
Design Sharing¡± campaign, and support programs geared toward children in underprivileged families, by leveraging
our talents and resources. Moreover, we have made active efforts for the conservation of Dokdo since 2008, carrying
out various public awareness campaigns on Dokdo to encourage involvement in protecting the island.
This report can only touch on a few of the key ways we are determined to create value, and is by no means meant to
be restrictive. Our efforts are ongoing, as we continue to push ourselves further to become a market-leading global
player operating based on sustainable business principles and practices.
I sincerely appreciate your interest in LG Hausys, and would like to ask for your continued support as we take bold
steps into the future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
542,LG Hausys,4,Korea,"I¡¯d like to extend my deepest gratitude to our valued stakeholders for their
on-going interest in and support for LG Hausys.
This year, LG Hausys presents its fifth sustainability report to disclose
its wide-ranging initiatives and achievements undertaken to advance its
sustainable growth in the economic, environmental and social arenas. In
publishing this report, we aim to help you understand our sustainability
management and integrated your invaluable feedback in our business
conduct.
LG Hausys is Korea¡¯s largest manufacturer of building & decorative
materials, high performance materials and automotive materials &
components. We utilize our core technology to consistently explore future
growth areas such as energy-saving windows, noise-attenuation flooring,
high-performance insulation materials, lightweight automotive parts,
acrylic solid surface, high-performance interior design films and other
various developments.Even though we faced challenging business conditions last year due to
the sluggish growth of the upstream market and increasingly intensifying
competition in respective business areas, we managed to generate
stunning outcomes, posting KRW 2.7686 trillion in sales and KRW 150.1
billion in operating profits. While our sales fell by 0.8% from the previous
year, our operating profits rose by 1.0% during the same period. I believe
this can be attributed to our heart-felt endeavors for product innovation,
cost innovation, and sales innovation to usher in fundamental change to
our business structure.
In 2016, we expect an even more challenging business environment.
This is mainly due to the sustained period of low-growth?brought about
by reduced consumption, the prolonged sluggishness of exports and an
increased volatility of the global economy. Yet, despite such circumstances,
we are determined to overcome this crisis by tapping new opportunities?
such as an increasing demand for energy-saving and eco-friendly
building materials and a wider adoption of lightweight parts to satisfy
strengthened fuel efficiency regulations.Moreover, we will focus on making investments in R&D and recruiting
talented researchers in order to set the stage for fostering a marketleading
business and discovering continuous sources of new growth
engines.
At LG Hausys, our vision is to ¡®create eco-conscious, human-friendly living
spaces¡¯. This embodies our commitment in creating living spaces where
our customers are truly contented and where we create new value for our
customers. Each and every LG Hausys employee strives to lead the market
through the consistent delivery of human-friendly, eco-conscious and
energy-saving products.
We undertake the following sustainability management initiatives as a
way to achieve this vision at LG Hausys.
First, we strengthen our product R&D capability to secure our growth
engine.
In 2015, our R&D investment amounted to KRW 55.8 billion, up by 242.%
from 2014. We attended the LG Techno Conference, forged a partnership
with the Seoul National University to promote joint research on new
technology and industry-academia cooperation, and worked with Harvard
University in the U.S. to conduct joint research on green buildings as a
way to secure an R&D workforce and new technology. These endeavors
allowed our ship flooring products and lightweight automotive parts to
gain the Korean ¡®New Excellent Technology¡¯ certification, and our green
automotive skin manufactured with botanically-based bio materials was
honored with the Jang Young-Shil Award.
Second, we expand our global market reach to solidify our global
presence.
In the Middle East, Southeast Asia, India and other emerging markets as
well as the U.S. and China, we launched products that cater to specific
local market needs to discover new growth opportunities and expand our
overseas sales. In 2015, we opened branches in Dubai and Jakarta, and our
Wuxi branch in China initiated the operation of its flooring plant. We also
constructed an automotive skin plant and expanded the engineered stone
production line in the U.S., thereby broadening our overseas production
and sales bases.
Third, we broaden our green product portfolio to establish our green
leadership.
We established our ¡®Green Identify¡¯ to deliver green products including,
but not limited to, energy-saving and eco-friendly building materials and
lightweight automotive parts with an aim to provide human-friendly
products. This, in return, enables us to gain even more green certifications
in Korea and abroad. We are the 1st?ever building material maker in China
to be listed on the Top 10 Eco-friendly Real Estate for three consecutive
years, and our ZEA Sorijam, ZEA wallpaper and PF board insulation were
named ¡°Green Products of the Year Chosen by Korean Consumers¡¯ for
two consecutive years, demonstrating our achievement in delivering green
products.
Fourth, we create an eco-friendly and safe workplace.
We invest and conduct self-initiated reviews of our plant equipment and
facilities, both in Korea and abroad so as to prevent any incident that may
impact our operations. We plan to intensively examine our workplace
safety management system at all our plants and to conduct practical
mock drills to ensure executive-level management accountability and
prevent accidents. This will help us create an even safer workplace.
Fifth, we build a market-leading organizational culture.
To become a market leader recognized by customers, all our employees at
LG Hausys take the 'F4 ' (Focus, Fun, Fair, Fast) perspective in accelerating
their performance while undertaking future-oriented activities based
on their group creativity and spontaneity. Our endeavors to establish a
market-leading organizational culture earned us the title ¡®Great Work
Place Korea 2015¡¯.
Sixth, we consistently implement supplier programs to promote
shared growth mutual benefit.
We assist our suppliers in building capacity through joint technology
development and patent application, and business & financial support
while constantly communicating with the management of our suppliers
as a way to promote mutual benefits. Furthermore, we introduced a
mutually-beneficial payment system to widen the scope of our support
to include tier 2 and below suppliers so as to pursue shared growth along
the entire supply chain.
We at LG Hausys will employ a variety of methods to grow hand in hand
with our community and position ourselves as a market leader respected
by society.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to you for your unchanging concern and affection toward LG H&H. Last year, the economic recession in both the domestic and overseas markets caused LG H&H to fail to perform according to its own expectations. The steadfast support of its stakeholders, however, and the consistent efforts of its employees enabled the company to achieve record-breaking performance in both sales and operating incomes, thus strengthening its market position. The difficulty in the management surroundings, however, is expected to continue. LG H&H carries forward a business strategy to secure mid-long term growth engines while raising the degree of its completion of its existing businesses with the aim of turning the crisis into an opportunity. At the same time, we will aggressively participate in sustainable management activities through the reinforcement of our authentic communication with our customers for future value creation, improving our stakeholder¡¯s value and leading the market. Securing of Mid-Long Term Growth Engines At the cosmetic business level, we will endeavor to stabilize and globalize our established local bases in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and North America in record time to go beyond the South Korean market. At the same time, we are planning to launch THEFACESHOP, whose market-leading potential has been proven, first in the local bases, in a bid to create synergy while procuring additional local bases. In addition, we are going to expand the health functional food segment in an attempt to overcome the stagnation of growth in the domestic household goods market. The continuous growth of our health functional food business will be enabled by our efforts to reinforce our product portfolios, expand our market and sales channels, and enter the rapidly growing functional beverage and functional milk product markets. Strategic Sustainability Management Activities To realize our vision of becoming ¡°the best sustainable FMCG company¡±, LG H&H holds CSR meetings, the in-house decision-making entity for sustainable management, and panel meetings involving external experts on a regular basis, consolidating our integrated CSR system, which has received positive responses from various evaluation groups. The company has been included in DJSI (Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes) Asia Pacific for four consecutive years, has ranked first on the Green Ranking list in the consumer goods sector for two consecutive years, and has ranked third on the list of ¡°KOSPI 100 Good Companies.¡± Creation of Sustainable Future Value LG H&H has been providing various kinds of support to its business partners for win-win growth, including the expansion of the win-win growth fund and COD (cash on delivery), and joint technology development. We have also made a diagnosis of our 215 major business partners for their CSR activities to build up their CSR capacities. Furthermore, with the aim of enlarging the leverage of its social contribution on the local community, LG H&H has carried out a variety of activities to realize the dream, beauty, and healthy life of children, adolescents, and women in the ¡°Beautiful¡± (cosmetics), ¡°Healthy¡± (household goods), and ¡°Refreshing¡± (beverages) business segments. Beyond mere donations, LG H&H has been executing a new social-contribution program, utilizing the company¡¯s resources and technologies.

LG H&H will continue to exert its best efforts to comply with UN Global Compact¡¯s ten principles, and to fulfill the company¡¯s social responsibility in pursuit of a better society in the future. Our stakeholders¡¯ unwavering support and affection will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

and employees of LG H&H are continuously carrying out various efforts to help customers discover their
beauty and realize their dreams.
In 2015, despite the slow growth of the world economy and sluggish domestic market demand due to the
outbreak of MERS, we achieved remarkable performance in the areas on which we strategically focused based
on our experience, determination, and ability to put our ideas into practice.
Also to fulfill our corporate social responsibility (CSR), we ran the CSR Committee regularly to discuss major
sustainability issues, gathered advices from CSR expert panels, and reflected their opinions into our business activities.
Based on these efforts, we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for six consecutive years
and selected as the Leader of the Carbon Disclosure Project for two year in a row. Moreover, we achieved the
first class rating in the Win-Win Growth Index and won the Korea Sustainability Company Awards.Considering the expected slowdown in the global market affected by the decreasing economic growth rate in
China and the prolonged economic downturn in Europe, we will further strive to lead the market and pursue
sustainable growth in three aspects as follows.
Focusing on Key Business Areas and Developing New Growth Engines
In order to improve our business expertise and product premiumization, we will think outside the old
boundary upon the reorganizing of business system, and focus on key business areas where we can create
differentiated customer value. We will then continue to foster overseas business through our luxury brands,
Whoo and Su:m that are competitive in China and also enter global personal care market.
Maintaining the Trust of Customers
LG H&H will become socially responsible and trusted company by expanding its activities in transparent
and sustainability management. With the Chungbuk Creative Economy Support Foundation, we plan to
aid startups realize their innovative capacity into products, pursue win-win growth with our suppliers, and
further comply with fair trade throughout the company. Also, we will operate the business-related educational
program, the Borrowed Earth School which habituates students to environmentally friendly lifestyle, to
invigorate the Free Semester Program in middles schools, thereby extending our impact in local community.
Strengthening Sustainable Management through Communication with Stakeholders
We believe that support and attention from our customers, suppliers, employees, and investors are the main
driving force behind LG H&H. In return, we will tighten relationship with customers by creating safe products,
promote win-win growth with suppliers, support career development of employees, and build advanced
labor-management culture. Our biannual expert panel discussions about CSR Issues will be held quarterly.
We will also converge communication channels with suppliers into the CEO Academy, thus promoting
sustainability management to secondary and tertiary suppliers.
LG H&H's 2015 CSR Report, the 7th report to be published, shares performance and activities of its sustainability
management. As a global leader of sustainability management, LG H&H promises to not only comply with the Ten
Principles of the UN Global Compact, but also commit to fulfilling CSR for the better future.

112,LG Innotek Cooperation,2,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders,
Recently, several tragic accidents captured Korea by surprise, sending
a wakeup call for safety practices throughout society. Witnessing
these series of accidents reminded me, as a corporate citizen, of the
significance that corporate social responsibility plays in society.
Adherence to Basic Principles
These tragic accidents hung heavy on the minds of many Koreans
because they might have been prevented if only we were more vigilant
in adhering to basic principles. Everyone knows maintaining high
principles is critical, as it can often prevent accidents. In fact, it also
forms the basis of sustainability management and is indispensable
to corporate sustainability. In that same context, LG Innotek¡¯s sustainability
report details every effort LG Innotek has made over the
past year in complying with basic principles in its economic, social
and environmental activities.
Implementing the Inherent Roles of
a Respected Corporate Citizen
Economically, sustainable management can be realized on the
premise that a business is equipped with differentiated competitiveness
in its business domain?the inherent purpose of its existence
at the outset. At the same time, a company needs to foster its future
growth engines by seizing on business opportunities in new areas
and related industries. To that end, LG Innotek applies its utmost
efforts to cultivate market leadership and augment its business
fundamentals. While proactively pursuing new markets through
technology convergence, we are ambitiously introducing new market-
leading products based on innovative ideas and an enterprising
spirit.
Social and Environmental Responsibilities
Socially, LG Innotek is involved in social contribution activities with a
focus on fostering future generations and heightening community
engagement. In 2014, we plan on further expanding the scope of our
social contribution through collaboration with governmental agencies
and NGOs. At the same time, we have diverse activities planned
that will help our employees strike a healthy work-life balance so
that we can realize a great workplace where people actually want
to go to work.
When it comes to our environmental responsibilities, we are taking
a company-wide approach to protect the environment for future
generations. This includes carbon management, eco-friendly product
development and energy conservation campaigns. We are also
meeting all of the government¡¯s requirements and applying stricter
standards to internal environmental management. Furthermore, we
run regular preventive drills like evacuation and fire drills in preparation
for unforeseen safety accidents.
Sustainability Management Vision and Commitment
LG Innotek¡¯s vision slogan is ¡°Inside your life,¡± which refers to the
company¡¯s cutting-edge innovative technologies contributing to a
safer, happier and more convenient future for everyone. It also captures
our commitment to bringing about a safer and more convenient
life with our products and technologies. This is our pledge to
sustainability management practices as part of our corporate social
responsibility fulfillment.
As a faithful corporate citizen, LG Innotek fully abides by basic principles
in all its economic, social and environmental activities. I humbly
ask for your continued support as we move forward with these
endeavors down the road.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,LG Innotek Cooperation,3,Korea,"Dear stakeholders, In 2014, despite the tough global business environment, LG Innotek successfully achieved the highest revenue since its founding. It was a feat attributed to our enduring commitment to raising quality competitiveness and productivity as well as strengthening business fundamentals and profitability through attracting new customers and reorganizing the business structure. We have also strengthened our social responsibility throughout the year by taking preemptive responses to climate change and tightening environmental regulations, promoting shared growth with suppliers, and expanding social contribution activities. LG Innotek will push forward with the following activities in 2015 to ensure sustainable growth. We will take sustainable competitiveness to the next level. The ever-changing business environment defies any stability and predictability. In addition, the protracted economic slowdown is aggravating certain business environments. To ride out those management adversities and find a sustainable growth path, it is imperative that we put meticulously crafted business strategies into action. To this end, LG Innotek will focus on ¡°substantive growth¡± and ¡°enhanced preparations for the future.¡± The Company will solidify its market dominance in mainstay business in order to substantive growth.

to realize its sustainability management vision ""Right Promise, Better Tomorrow."" We make a concerted
effort not only to operate our businesses environmentally and ethically but also to create a great
workplace where employees are able to work in safe environments and respected with their values.
Sustainable growth comes from securing business competitiveness.
While all our business activities are indissolubly linked with sustainability management, the most fundamental
element is securing business competitiveness. The essence of our businesses consists in
supporting our customers to achieve striking performances in the market. Therefore, we believe the
basic corporate social responsibility at LG Innotek is to consistently enhance the competitive edge
of our products with an insight into customer value, through which we meet customer needs, solve
their pain points, and ultimately deliver differentiated values. To fulfill the commitment, we will focus
on innovating our business competitiveness and accelerating the development and cultivation of new
business opportunities in the coming year. Inspection on competitiveness in existing businesses and
innovation throughout the value chain will be implemented to ensure higher operational efficiency and
productivity. Efforts for securing new growth engines will continue as well.
We will be more sincere and dedicated to fulfilling our social responsibility.
LG Innotek will adopt stricter internal criteria to environmental management beyond just complying
with regulations in order to join the global efforts for solving environmental issues. Our commitment
to environment will be stiffened from the stage of research and development, the initial point of a
product, by developing and adopting eco-friendly materials and expanding low-power product design.
In addition, we will do our utmost to conform to basics and principles to ensure safety and finally build
a accident-free workplace. On top of that, we will also be dedicated to winning stakeholders' trust by
implementing Jeong-Do management, expanding activities for co-prosperity with suppliers, abiding by
fair transactions, and actively communicating with local communities.

118,LOTTE CHEMICAL,1,Korea,"Amid the persistent global economic recession due to the financial crisis in the Euro zone and China¡¯s sluggish
economic growth, many companies have difficulties in business activities nowadays. In such situation, Lotte
Chemical pursues sustainable growth with its vision of ¡°Top-tier Asian Chemical Company.¡±
We have secured Korea¡¯s No. 1 ethylene production facilities by successfully expanding the Yeosu Plant¡¯s NCC
(naphtha cracking center) in 2012 through steady facility investment and efforts to develop technologies despite
an uncertain business environment. We have also built PE and PP plants with our own technologies, exported
licenses, and consequently achieved the feat of having our technological excellence recognized abroad
as well. We are committed to growing as a global company through accountable and responsible management
regardless of the circumstances.
Thanks to your support and encouragement, Honam Petrochemical and its subsidiary, KP Chemical, completed
the merger in December 2012, and Lotte Chemical was reborn. The merger has become an opportunity to cement
our competitiveness further by consolidating organizational capability and securing new growth engines.
We will make the merger and change of company name a steppingstone to take off anew and bolster our status
as a social company that grows together with customers and partner companies.
Lotte Chemical advances toward its vision of becoming a top-tier Asian chemical company. I believe such vision
cannot be accomplished with only external growth and performance in financial management. We will pursue
socially responsible management and sustainability management to realize such vision, fulfill our role in accordance
with our position, and do our very best to meet your expectations.
Our sustainability management activities and performance are delivered to stakeholders through this annually
published sustainability report; we collect various opinions and reflect them transparently on our management
activities.
Thanks to our diverse efforts for sustainability management, we have been included in the DJSI Asia Pacific for
the second consecutive year and chosen as a leading company in the raw material sector in CDP (carbon disclosure
project) Korea. We operate the KRW 87 billion Mutual Growth Fund for mutual growth with partner companies
and actively carry out competitiveness fortification for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through the
Mutual Growth Academy. We also engage in various sharing activities for the underprivileged within communities
including offering scholarships for adolescents and home repair volunteer service as a community member.
We promise to pull out all the stops in providing tangible/intangible assistance for the community¡¯s growth and
development.
Lotte Chemical will contribute to humans¡¯ enriched life, based on sustainable growth under management principles
such as customer-oriented mindset, creativity, cooperation, performance-based pay, and passion as our core
values. We vow to develop as a company trusted and loved by various stakeholders with further consolidated
efforts to fulfill our social responsibility.
I cordially ask for your unwavering encouragement and support.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
546,LOTTE CHEMICAL,4,Korea,"This year is very meaningful as it marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of Lotte Chemical. We started by taking a step in
Yeosu Petrochemical Complex forty years ago with the help of hard-earned overseas capital and, we have now grown to a global
chemical firm that leads a number of domestic and overseas subsidiaries. All credit for this sea change goes to the support and interest
from the stakeholders. I would like to extend my heart-felt appreciation to all of you, stakeholders.
On the occasion of the 40th anniversary, Lotte Chemical set up a ¡°Global Top 10 Chemical Company¡± as a new corporate vision. To realize
the goal, we are actively working on sustainable management. We have published sustainability report every year and utilize it
as a communication channel with external stakeholders.
Capitalizing on the capability and experiences accumulated during the history of us, we struck strategic large-scale M&A deals that enabled
us to realize the economy of scale. We also take pride in our technological prowess, strong enough to build overseas plants on our
own. In particular, we have grown to a comprehensive chemical firm, by securing the capabilities of producing diversified products from
petrochemical-based materials, including of olefin and aromatic series, to functional resin. Now, we are leading the Korean petrochemical
industry through the development of high value-added products , which are also environmental-friendly . These products are the reward
for our continued R&D efforts and brought us an excellent business result last year.
In the meantime, the current business environment calls for new challenges and innovation from Lotte Chemical. Continued low oil
prices, possible interest rate hikes of the US and the slowing growth of the Chinese economy that is the biggest demand source are
our major risk factors. In addition, domestic petrochemical players that use low-cost feedstock are waging ever-fiercer competition
against each other, while refineries are expanding their presence to the petrochemical business. China has also been increasing its
self-sufficiency, and leading companies are accelerating the pace of technology monopolization. All these are aggravating difficulties
in business.
To tackle these challenges, Lotte Chemical made its initial foray into the synthetic rubber business through partnership. In addition,
we secured an opportunity to diversify our business portfolio via the acquisition of chemical businesses of Samsung affiliates chemical
businesses , which can help bolster both the engineering plastic business and the fine chemical business. As an effort to make diversifications
in the feedstock supply chain, we completed the construction of a chemical complex in Surgil, Uzbekistan. In addition,
we are implementing the US shale gas-based project as well as the joint venture project with Hyundai Oilbank as planned.
We are making all-out efforts to develop environmentally friendly technology, by fortifying research not only on products of existing
businesses, but also on megatrends that center on water processing, energy storage system (ESS) and bio products.
Globally, corporate social responsibility that is mainly about environment and safety, ethical management, mutual growth and
co-prosperity with local community does not end in an obligation that a company has to fulfill. It is a factor that determines the life
and death of a business. All employees of Lotte Chemical put environment and safety ahead of anything else and strengthen corresponding
efforts. The company also makes efforts to use energy efficiently and minimize greenhouse gas emissions and environmental
degradation. For ethical management practice, we run the ethical management system under which we hold weekly ethical management
education and operate ¡°Shinmungo¡±, all of which is designed to establish transparency and fairness in transactions. To grow
with partners, we are running Mutual Growth Fund and are actively working on supportive steps that strengthen their competitiveness,
including Mutual Growth Academy and technological support. We are also carrying out various activities which have been conceived
to develop with local communities, including book donations to schools in our region, volunteer services for home repairs and
local talent employment.
Going forward, Lotte Chemical firmly promises to faithfully serve its due role as a social enterprise, listening to the voices of different
stakeholders with an open mind, and reflecting them actively in our business.
We ask for your interest in and support to Lotte Chemical as we proceed on our vision of becoming a ¡°Global Top 10 Chemical Company¡±,
growing beyond the development of the last four decades.
Lotte Chemical will be a company that is respected and entrusted through active communications with stakeholders, based on its
sustainability management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lotte Chilsung is actively pursuing mutual growth with partners through a range of activities established under the slogan of ¡®Our
partners¡¯ growth is our company¡¯s growth.¡¯ For example, in 2010, we set up a committee of mutual growth promotion, entered into
an agreement with partners about ¡®fair trade and mutual growth,¡¯ and offered some 10 billion KRW of loans to small and medium-sized
partners at low interest rates through operating the mutual growth fund. In addition, we operate a fair trade compliance program
(CP), maintain ethical management, and comply with fair trade practices.
Our company takes the initiative in helping the underprivileged through a variety of scholarship activities, food bank donations and
more. What¡¯s more, we contribute to the vitalization of the regional economy by hiring local people first at our 10 factories and at over
100 branch offices. In addition, our company is highly esteemed in labor-management culture thanks to the way it runs a suggestion
system and a variety of activities designed to ensure harmony between labor and management, not to mention smooth communication
between labor and management.
Lotte Chilsung will continuously strive to pursue our chief vision of becoming a world-class beverage company through growing
together with our local communities. In doing so, we will actively and transparently communicate with diverse stakeholders. We

123,LS Cable & System,1,Korea,"2012 is the year of the 50th anniversary of LS Cable & System. What do you think LS Cable & System¡¯s mindset would be
to achieve sustainable growth over the next 50 years?
We celebrated our 50th anniversary in 2012. To compare to human beings, we are at the age of looking back on ourselves and
prepare for another future, rather than just go forward. That is, it is the age of assuming responsibility for our own looks and
becoming enlightened about Province, after going through adolescence when we were willing to take a bold move. To achieve
sustainable growth and become a respected and loved company for the next 50 years, we think deeply our strengths and weaknesses
and prepare for the future with a modest attitude in 2013.
How do you evaluate the management performance in 2012?
In terms of business performance, we made progress compared to 2011, but with some setbacks. In 2012, global economic
recession was apparent as fiscal tightening in advanced countries was prevalent due to continuing fiscal crisis and as slow economic
growth was exhibited in developing countries, as well. In response, we coped with the sluggish economic growth by focusing on
our core business-such as extra high voltage cables?and by expanding meaningful overseas contracts in new business such as
submarine cables. Such efforts helped our separated earnings successfully return to black balance, but due to the reduced income and
unexpected non-recurring losses of domestic and overseas subsidiaries, we failed to achieve the same outcome in the consolidated
income statement. In order to create economic value as the fundamental of sustainable management, all of our employees will do
their best by implementing crisis management for overcoming the current hostile business conditions.
For future business, I think we laid the foundation for the company¡¯s future growth with meaningful performances
including large scale submarine cable projects and new power cable manufacturing facilities in the U.S., China, and India.
In particular, the power cable manufacturing facility newly constructed in China may produce up to 500kV class products. We believe
this will be an opportunity to upgrade our ability to provide product with high quality and high technologies to customers in China
as well as in the rest of the world.
We found the power of LSpartnership in the corporate partnership with suppliers and plan to continuously strengthen
this win-win growth relationship. We¡¯ve provided strategic supporting programs of finance, payment terms, R&D, training and
2nd tier supplier assistance with management of dedicated tem. In 2012, we succeed in 11 joint development projects with suppliers.
Through these corporative activities for win-win growth, we will provide greater value not only for ourselves and suppliers but also
for all communities.
In environment management, I would like to say that we have firmly established our green management system and
have expanded implementations. In 2012, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced in both total amount and intensity for three
consecutive years, and eco-friendly products reached 63 % of the number of the products. In particular, in line with the approach
to expand our efforts to preserve environmental value to the supply networks, we strongly support suppliers to respond to climate
change. We conducted an energy diagnosis of the supplier¡¯s worksites and supported the development of eco-friendly products.
Among them, 10 suppliers established their GHG inventory system.
However, there is a challenge that further improvement is needed. We want to drastically increase the level of green management as
our future business to lead the global green business. For this, we plan to expand development of green technology and products.Please explain the management policy for 2013.
Unfortunately, the global economic outlook for 2013 does not seem bright. Global economic recession will likely last for a while.
Therefore the competition among companies for survival seems to be fiercer as well. Even though we are facing a difficult business
environment, we established the following management policies to overcome this challenge and achieve the business objectives.
First, we will innovate profit model.
We will intensify our efforts to achieve better results in our new businesses including submarine cable business, while maintaining
profitability in the main businesses such as extra high voltage cable business. We will also be committed to maximizing the
performance of our subsidiaries and realizing investment performance earlier.
Second, we will strengthen global competitiveness.
We will secure competitiveness by satisfying our customers with high quality, competitive
price and on-time delivery. We must ensure that the already established business model
lead will lead to actual performance. By fully utilizing our global bases, we need to
identify customers¡¯ needs and realize them in entire product life cycle.
Third and lastly, we will realize responsible management.
All of us will complete our jobs, focusing on execution. To give more value back to stakeholders,
we will strive to achieve our goals, incorporating this attitude into our corporate culture.
We also will become a trustworthy company to shareholders, customers, employees,
and local communities through fair competition and strengthened risk management.
We will create a new history over the next 50 years, driven by creative energy
by strengthening our ability in the current crisis.
We look forward to your advice and supports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will serve as a compass which guides executives and employees on the right path when they
make decisions or work.
Through LS C&S Way, the vision the company aims to achieve is 'Enable the Cabled World'.
It means the company grows as a 'total cable solutions provider' based on its expertise in the cable
industry so as to provide energy and information anywhere in the world, thereby making
the world brighter and richer.
There are four core values to achieve this vision :Customer First
We put our customers on our top priority and provide them with best values.

Thoroughness and perfection on our products and services should be pursued.

548,LS Cable & System,4,Korea,"First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all stakeholders for
your continued interest in and support for LS Cable & System.
I am very pleased to have this sixth edition of the Sustainability Report published as a channel to communicate with you.
The purpose of this report is to share with you what we achieved socially and economically last year and what we have been striving to
achieve for sustainable and qualitative growth.
The year 2016 is meaningful for us as we open the ¡®second phase of business management¡¯ to pursue changes and innovation.
For the last three years, we have experienced difficulties at home and abroad, but we have intensified our efforts to revamp the organization
based on a ¡®selection and concentration¡¯ strategy. As a result, a foundation for growth has been built on which we are preparing for a new growth.
I believe the second phase will serve as an opportunity to show you our true strength and value. We will not pursue growth just for showing off.
We will pursue solid and qualitative growth so that our organization and businesses will grow gradually.
To fulfill corporate social, economic, environmental responsibility, we are conducting business based on ¡®C.O.R.E¡¯, or four core values: customer first;

550,LS is,4,Korea,"I take great pleasure in presenting the 2nd Sustainability Report as part of our endeavors to engage
with stakeholders in a continued communication following the 1st report which came out last year. As
we were compiling this report, in particular this year, it was our hope that this report would elaborate
on our efforts and achievements in environmental management in a more faithful manner.
In 2015, the international community approved the Paris Agreement, marking the birth of a new
climate change framework to mitigate the Earth¡¯s average temperature rise. The Korean Government,
on its part, will strive to promote ¡®new energy industry¡¯ to meet the goal of GHG emissions cut. The
dwindling infrastructure investment due to the slowdown in global economy poses tough challenges
to management environment. However, LSIS, with its proven capabilities in power and energy, is
poised to turn the crisis into opportunity.
As most of the businesses LSIS has invested in to identify the future growth engine encompass new
energy industry, our values, as represented by the vision of ¡®Futuring Smart Energy¡¯, will only grow in
the coming years. Smart Energy and Smart Factory Solution, in particular, are expected to contribute
not only to the nation¡¯s economic advancement but also to the mitigation of climate change.
Generating economic outcomes and reaping the benefits together with stakeholders by joining the
global efforts for responding to climate change, our business model faithfully delivers corporate social
responsibility and sustainability management values. The Vision 2020 embodies our aspiration to
become a great company (Great) which promotes efficiency (Green) on the global arena (Global).
We are seeing tangible outcomes on the horizon. Following the construction of the mega-size
photovoltaic power plant in Mito, Japan last year, we won the bid to build a major photovoltaic power
plant in Chitose, Hokkaido this year. Our business in China and Southeast Asia is also experiencing
favorable growth. The high-efficiency drive product ¡®iG5A¡¯ realized a record high in sales as a single
brand in Korea.
Furthermore, we have reestablished the standards on eco-friendly products to minimize their impact
on environment while increasing investment in environment and safety to develop green products
and improve process. Employees¡¯ enhanced awareness of safety and accident prevention process
has allowed LSIS to keep its worksites free from accident since 2012. We strive to make sure the
environmental safety culture we established is replicated by our suppliers, thereby creating new
shared values.
We make lasting efforts to embrace local communities in growth and communication, for example, by
supporting welfare facilities for marginalized groups. This year, LSIS and its suppliers will jointly carry
out social contribution activities to benefit more people in need.
As we make progress on the long journey towards sustainability management, LSIS pledges to
abide by the global standards on corporate social responsibility while fulfilling its duties as a healthy
corporate citizen.
We look forward to your unwavering interest in and encouragement for us in the years to come.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,LS Mtron,1,Korea,"LS Mtron¡¯s vision is to become an Innovative Technology Partner that contributes to a convenient, comfortable and flourishing
world for its customers through its products and services. While we have continued to grow substantially through our ceaseless
efforts, we are now ready to make a lengthened stride toward sustainability management to reach even greater goals.
In 2012, our commitment was further strengthened to develop global top-notch products and technology. Through sustain-
able innovation across the entire business spectrum, and the breakdown of limitations(by way of unshakable confidence and
enthusiasm in attaining the goal of becoming and the No. 1 company, No. 1 talent and No. 1 corporate culture), such a commit-
ment was readily apparent. As a result, our Tractor Division became Korea¡¯s first in market share and the CF division laid the
foundation for future growth through the development of remarkable technology. Thanks to its stable quality, the Electronic
Component Division also made significant achievements in generating sales from large global customers and tapping into
the export market. It is quite impressive that such sustainable growth and the creation of economic value was possible, even
in the face of challenging business conditions. At LS Mtron, sustainability management is recognized as the most important
business principle that enables us to deliver new customer value and stakeholder satisfaction while preventing and managing
both financial and non-financial risks. Specifically, 2012 was a year when tremendous endeavors were put into establishing
integrated sustainability management. This was done to ingrain sustainability seamlessly into the entire business spectrum,
which includes daily operations and decision-making.Win-win Partnership
We believe that our competitive edge in sustainable development originates from strengthened communication with our
suppliers and endeavors for shared growth on the basis of a culture of fair transactions. The private-public joint investment
technology development project, which constitutes LS Mtron¡¯s representative shared growth program, was undertaken consis-
tently with a total of KRW 13.2 billion in investments made in 18 projects under progress in 2012(9 projects in 2011).
Quality and Customer Satisfaction
Our commitment to retaining quality talent, in an aim to deliver the products and services that our customers truly need, led
to a 6% increase in the retainment of quality expert qualifications from 9% in 2011 to 15% in 2012 while the retainment of ISO 9001 certification examiners reached 46%. The fact that we do everything in our power for enhanced customer trust
and convenience is demonstrated through the strengthened management of customer communication and customer contact
points, including the operation of the integrated call center.
Social Contribution
As a company committed to the joint growth and development of local communities, we strove to ensure the systemized
operation of the 2nd-term ¡°Global Happy Village¡± campaign over the past year. Under this representative social contribution
program, employee volunteerism was expanded and local volunteer activities were facilitated at respective business sites.
Green Management and Stronger Technological Competitive Edge
At LS Mtron, we address climate change through the reduction of GHG emissions, the operation of a safe, healthy and eco-
friendly workplace and through the expansion of eco-friendly products and green business. We are fully committed to develop-
ing technological capabilities in eco-friendly product technology that spans the development of hybrid tractors, UC modules
for hybrid vehicles and high-capacity battery packs for mobile devices.
Employee Value Enhancement
Our initiatives for enhanced employee value include the development of fair and systemic HR systems, consistent support for
building employee capacity and work/life balance, the establishment of a trust-based labor-management culture and respect
for human rights and diversity. Furthermore, HR regulations were devised for our overseas subsidiaries while training pro-
grams, the intensive leave program and the Happy Family Day program, were all improved.
In 2012, the 1st-term sustainability management initiatives that were fully launched in 2010 were completed. Over the past
three years, we have built a company-wide infrastructure and a broader consensus for sustainability management, while de-
veloping communication systems to build closer ties with and bring satisfaction to stakeholders. Furthermore, we defined the
requirements for eco-friendly products and integrated them in our R&D processing while developing the company-wide risk
management system. All of these accomplishments were made possible through the company-wide Sustainability Manage-
ment Steering Group, which faithfully played a pivotal role through the 20 plus group meetings that were consistently held.
As 2012 marks a year for launching the 2nd-term sustainability management at LS Mtron, we have set the goal to strengthen
our leadership in global standards on the basis of our stakeholder communication capabilities that were built over the years
and on the development of a competitive edge to focus on the overseas market more intensively. Furthermore, we will further
integrate the respective functions of sustainability management and elevate the level of implemented tasks in order to generate
substantial stakeholder values while establishing a more detailed risk management system.
Everyone at LS Mtron is committed to sincerely advancing sustainability management through the deeper understanding of all
our stakeholders that is based on proactive communication. We are determined to lead our industry peers through best prac-
tices in business innovation in the global machinery and component industry. I would like to ask for your continued interest
in our fourth M-Story and your honest feedback will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,LS Mtron,2,Korea,"Q. Five years have passed since the inception of LS Mtron. Can you tell us about the endeavors and
achievements made by LS Mtron over the past five years?
Customer satisfaction and shared growth with stakeholders have been our top priorities and they served as the
basis for our rapid growth. LS Mtron has continued to grow over the last five years, and in 2013, our sales reached
KRW 2 trillion, which is up 2.5 times from when the company was first established. This would not have been possible
without all our employees who were united behind our business policies to ¡®Build a stronger a global competitive
edge¡¯, ¡®Breakthrough limitations¡¯ and ¡®No. 1 Mtron People¡¯. Another significant contributor to these achievements
is our corporate culture that encourages employees to do whatever they can to deliver both customer satisfaction and
satisfaction among the wider group of stakeholders.Q. What are the values and achievements that have been created through the sustainability management
initiatives undertaken so far?
Initiated along with the inception of the company, our sustainability management forms the foundation of
LS Mtron and boosts our business fundamentals. It is through sustainability management that we build upon our
steadfast business fitness that enables us to grow, even in the face of rapidly shifting business conditions. At LS Mtron,
our sustainability management initiatives are integrated on a job and department level and contribute to improving work
practices and facilitating a corporate culture. In return, this helps our employees recognize sustainability management
as an essential part of their daily operations and practice sustainability management in close alignment with their
responsibility. Specifically, the ¡®Sustainability Management Steering Group¡¯, whose operations have been ongoing
over the last five years, has been positioned as a representative instrument in enabling inter-departmental
communication and collaboration. Our sustainability report ¡®M-Story¡¯ (which celebrates its fifth anniversary
this year) is also crucial in improving the value of LS Mtron and the pride of our employees in being part of the
company. Behind all these achievements is the convergence of communication, teamwork and LS Mtron¡¯s unique value
that our employees live by: LS Mtron people ¡®immediately¡¯ take action ¡®no matter what¡¯ ¡®until they reach their goal¡¯.
It is only natural that these accomplishments, in turn, lead to sustainable growth.Q. What are LS Mtron¡¯s top priorities in advancing sustainability management in 2014?
To strengthen our capability as a Global Player based on sustainability management, we will focus on the following
initiatives in 2014.
First, we will conduct in-depth customer interviews and surveys concerning our tractor and injection
molding operations, as a way to build further communication capabilities and credibility with our
stakeholders.
Second, we will assist our overseas subsidiaries (mainly in China) in establishing sustainability
management systems to secure a global competitive edge in sustainability management.
Specifically, our Chinese subsidiaries will be directly evaluated on their sustainability management
initiatives and financial performance to help them build stronger executive capabilities.
Third, we will take a comprehensive approach in managing risks (preventing the risk of local regulatory
violations) while aiding overseas subsidiaries with improving their local operational capabilities.
Fourth, eco-friendly design factors that reflect division-specific characteristics will be developed to take
the lead in developing green products and to respond to the growing green product market.
Fifth, we will not only disseminate sustainability management to our suppliers, but also assist them in
advancing sustainability management so as to facilitate shared growth along our value chain.
Q. How do you see LS Mtron¡¯s sustainable growth vision for the next five years?
After five years of remarkable progress, people might suspect that such success could lead us straight into the trap of
complacency. Yet, we at LS Mtron will not fall into that trap. Rather, we will continue to endeavor great pursuits, return
to the basics and start anew. We are faced with severe uncertainties and fluctuations in our company, both internally
and externally and this challenges us to make fundamental changes and sustainable innovations. Thus, we will focus on
improving the quality of our operations, with an emphasis on efficiency.
Specifically, the key initiative for our sustainable growth in the next five years will be listening to the voice of
our stakeholders and doing our utmost to deliver greater satisfaction and credibility to them. We believe in the
importance of seamless communication with stakeholders as a way to take the lead in developing quality products.
It is also instrumental in preemptively responding to the expectations and requirements of customers, markets and other
stakeholders. It is through such endeavors that we are taking the lead in gaining market intelligence and that we are
leading changing market conditions and creating forward-looking value (eco-friendly products).
Q. What is the purpose and what are the applicable principles of LS Mtron¡¯s sustainability report?
LS Mtron¡¯s sustainability reports enable us to reflect on the past year and identify necessary improvements and they also
serve their basic role, as a communication channel for our stakeholders. We at LS Mtron, vow to present what we are
as a company?a company that operates in a transparent and credible manner through sustainability reporting.
In addition, our sustainability reports will evolve as a communication channel to take a mutually-beneficial approach in
overcoming challenges and seeking shared growth with our customers, suppliers and any other stakeholders who may
interact with us. This year¡¯s M-Story summarizes our activities from the past five years and presents our commitment
to reach new frontiers. All LS Mtron employees, including myself, believe that our top priority is to communicate with
our stakeholders more proactively. Based on an in-depth understanding of our stakeholders, we will pursue sustainable
business that creates both credibility and value.
Dear Stakeholder, Your sincere interest and honest feedback on our fifth M-Story will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
549,LS Mtron,4,Korea,"Despite the fast changing external environment and the global economic crisis, LS Mtron has
been steadily growing. What do you think is behind such growth?
LS Mtron has continued to grow since its foundation in 2008. The sales of KRW 1 trillion in 2009 doubled
to KRW 2 trillion in 2015. In spite of the global economic slowdown and many uncertainties, we
have expanded the overseas market and produced results. I believe the driving force that keeps us
growing is the hard work and dedication of our employees for the global market.
In July 2015, a ceremony was held to proclaim the new vision of LS Mtron for the company¡¯s big
leap forward. Can you tell us about the new vision?
At a time when a new paradigm is emerging, we are striving to make a better tomorrow. Our employees
as well as partner companies and subsidiaries joined the ceremony to proclaim our new vision
¡®Be the One*¡¯. ¡®Be the one¡¯ means we are committed to becoming the best by working together¡¯. At
the same time it means our goals of: outstanding people; best-in-class products; and winning partnership.
How do you realize ¡®outstanding people, best-in-class products, and winning partnership¡¯?
And what is the ultimate goal you strive to achieve?
By encouraging employees to work from the perspective of offering values to customers and by
motivating them to continuously improve themselves, we will be able to secure top-notch talent.
If we make products which not only meet customer need but also satisfy the desire of customers
based our technological prowess and talented employees, customers will make us the number one
company. As we fully recognize the growth and development of stakeholders will ultimately lead to
our success in the long term, we will actively contribute to customers and local communities, thereby
realizing ¡®winning partnership¡¯. Based on all these efforts, we will achieve KRW 4.4 trillion of sales and
8.8% of pre-tax profit.
Lastly, please tell us about the company¡¯s commitment to communicating with stakeholders
for sustainability management and about the future plans.
LS Mtron will continue to spare no efforts to communicate with stakeholders in the areas for sustainability
management including innovation, quality, customer satisfaction, shared growth, green
management, ethical management, social contribution, technology development, and enhanced
employee value in order to become a trusted partner. In this regard, we have implemented various
communication channels to listen to our stakeholders, which is a starting point of communication.
We will continue to listen to our stakeholder so that we become a reliable and trusted partner marching
together toward the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

global leading energy company with the intent to expand the
business from power generation to new and renewable energy,
fuel cell and energy resources.
The year 2012 witnessed the best performance of the company
since its foundation in terms of growth, profit, and stability. The
sales reached KRW 2.8trillion, increased by KRW 1trillion from the
previous year, and the operating income recorded KRW 270billion.
However, the debt ratio stood at 173%, 70% down from the
previous year.
These achievements are all the more meaningful given that
the company achieved its growth through not only financial
performance but also environmental and social performance.
POSCO ENERGY has been making bold investments in the
commercialization of green energy technologies, such as the
fuel cell and the energy storage system, so that it can achieve
sustainable growth through future value creation. In the case of
the fuel cell, localization is now at the final stage after 7 years of
the multi-phase development, with the in-house production of the
key component, the Cell, expected in the near future.
In addition, the company is actively engaged in establishing an
eco-friendly workplace, expanding the new and renewable energy
business, and also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The
introduction of high-efficiency power facilities and air pollution
control systems has led to the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions per MWh by 19% and nitrogen oxide emissions per
MWh by 84% compared to 2009 levels. Moreover, the off-gas
power plant, which uses the off-gas generated from a steel mill toproduce electricity, and the Waste to Energy business, which uses
waste and sewage as energy sources, are all making significant
contributions to the creation of environmental value.
POSCO ENERGY has been building a corporate culture of
communicating, sharing, and growing together with its
stakeholders. The company has been putting in efforts for shared
growth through industrial ecosystem development including the
expansion of the domestic production of the fuel cell and the joint
development of the reaction-type steam turbine. When it comes
to social contribution activities, the company has taken advantage
of its energy business in setting ¡®environmental protection¡¯ and
¡®communication with local communities¡¯ as its basic directions,
and engaged in programs for enhancing energy efficiency for
people who cannot afford to buy energy. Moreover, it has been
promoting family-friendly management throughout the workplace
by opening an in-house nursery and adopting the flexible work
system.
POSCO ENERGY believes that sustainability management is no
longer a matter of will but of practice.
For sustainability management, POSCO ENERGY will internalize its
core values of Passion, Communication, Co-Success, and Green
Innovation into its management and corporate culture, create
a pleasant workplace that complies with basics and principles,
and become a much loved company that listens to and shares
happiness with its stakeholders.
I ask for your unwavering trust and support.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
552,POSCO Energy,4,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders, In 2015, POSCO ENERGY adopted four management directives: Upgrade, Simplification, Harmony, and Ethics. POSCO ENERGY has striven to upgrade the level of technology, processes, and human resources. We simplified work by eliminating inefficiencies, and ensured harmony and synergy through communication and collaboration. And finally, we put top priority on realizing ethical management. This report shows the economic value creation, social contribution, and environmental achievements in line with these four directives. As the world is entering the ¡°New Normal¡±era, the energy industry today faces a paradigm shift where power sources are shifting from large-scale and centralized to small-scale and decentralized, as well as from coal and nuclear to gas and new/renewable energies. We are witnessing the emergence of prosumers, and blurring borders among industries due to ICT-driven convergence and integration. Thenew energy business model is spread for responding to climate change after the COP 21 was held. Under these circumstances, POSCO ENERGY is fully committed to turn current challenges into opportunities for leaping forward through intensive innovation and competitive edge. In Incheon, POSCO ENERGY has improved profitability by replacing units 1 and 2 to the latest technology (unit 7, 8, 9) and plans to upgrade Power Plant under the Smart Grid Paradigm, getting ready to enter the heating energy supplying service as well. In Samcheok, POSCO ENERGY is constructing a 2,100MW capacity Coal-fired Thermal Power Plant adopting the USC technology. POSCO ENERGY started its commercial operation of Mong Duong II Coal-fired Thermal Power Plant (1,200MW) in Vietnam on April 2015. We secured business rights for power generation in Botswana, and signed an MOU with Iran for the construction of an Off-gas Combined Cycle Power Plant and desalination project. We will also begin construction of CHP-5 in Mongolia this year. Branching out from LNG and coal power plants, POSCO ENERGY is diversifying into new and renewable energy businesses including Solar Power, Wind Power, and Solid Refuse Fuel. Sustainability of an enterprise can be achieved only when its members are engaged in ceaseless ¡°innovation and learning¡±. POSCO ENERGY has achieved financial performance amounting to KRW 25.4 billion, and accomplished 20 cases of site improvements trough the PWS in 2015. With the operation the CoP (Community of Practice), our executives and employees share key knowledge within the company. While the concern about climate change is growing throughout the globe, POSCO ENERGY established a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory system to systematically manage GHG emission, listing their amounts by source. We consistently improve our facilities and R&D activities to decrease CO2 emissions. In 2015, POSCO ENERGY won the First Prize from the Ministry of Environment as an ¡°Excellent Case Presentation of an Air Pollutant Emission-cap Management System¡± for the outstanding performance in cutting down NOx emission by 27% or more compared to the previous year. POSCO ENERGY shares energy and comfort with the underprivileged people throughout all the business sites. In Incheon, executives, employees, their families, university student volunteer corps, and local residents have worked together to paint murals to brighten villages, carried out insulation work to create warmer and safer homes, and replaced aged electrical facilities. We also prepared winter kits and enacted voluntary work to provide drought relief in Samcheok while donating solar power generators in Gwangyang. POSCO ENERGY will strive to achieve mutual growth with all stakeholders as we grow into number one power and gas company in Asia leading new era of smart energy. I look forward to your continued support. Thank you.

133,"POSCO Engineering &Construction Co.,Ltd.",1,Korea,"Dear Our Stakeholders
It is an honor to present this, our second annual Sustainability
Report, to you.
POSCO E&C achieved a record over KRW 7 trillion in sales in
2012 despite the unfavorable business environment, marked
by a weak domestic construction market and sluggish global
economy. Our remarkable accomplishment is attributable
to the enthusiasm and dedication of all POSCO E&C
employees, who have continuously challenged themselves
to realize our vision of ¡°Evolving into One of the Global Top
10 E&C Companies by 2020.¡± Our race towards this vision is
driven by our forward thinking, advanced technologies, and
passion for what we do.
A shift in our business paradigm has also strengthened the
foundation for growth. Enterprises are now expected to
pursue sustainable growth from the long-term perspective,
moving beyond the conventional emphasis on immediate
profit and quantitative growth. Sustainability management
is especially important for the construction industry, which
has a major impact on economic, environmental, and social
value. We understand the importance of sustainability,
and our management program proactively addresses the
changes in the business environment and requirements
of our time. Our focus is on the following areas so that we
achieve sustainable growth and become a global E&C company
that all stakeholders admire:
Harmonization of Profit and Growth
We aim to build the very best steel plants, power plants, and
eco-friendly urban development, and explore profitable overseas
markets. Success in these areas will lay the groundwork for
sustainable growth and turn the currently tough business
environment into future opportunities. In addition, we will develop
core technologies, strengthen our quality competency
continuously and win high-quality projects while ensuring
qualitative growth centered on profitability and financial
soundness. Ongoing innovation will also reduce costs and
strengthen the profit structure so that we maintain a harmonization
of profit and growth.
Strengthening Environmental and
Safety Management
Global interest in protecting the environment and people
continues to increase, and any accident can incur serious
costs to both the company and the community at large. At
POSCO E&C, we realize the need to minimize environmental
impact and prevent accidents in all of our activities. In addition,
our management of greenhouse gas emissions has
been tightened by the establishment of a greenhouse gas
inventory, while the safety awareness of our employees has
been reinforced through monitoring and improved activities
at all worksites. POSCO E&C is firmly committed to improving
the environment and safety management system
constantly as well as to initiating onsite accident prevention
activities to increase awareness of our responsibility to
protect the environment and workers at all times at every
project site.
Improvement of the Shared Social Value
We aim to accommodate diverse stakeholder interests and
thereby earn the public trust in the course of doing our business.
Our social contribution activities are directed at helping
to resolve problems in the local communities neighboring
the sites so that we grow as those around us do. We also
provide our suppliers with a broad range of supports for
fair trade and Win-Win growth. We put our customers first
and develop customized solutions for them so that value
is raised for all parties. The Thanks-Sharing program participated
by all executives and employees will be embedded in
our company as a unique corporate culture to enhance their
sense of ownership, mutual trust, and the safety consciousness
at project sites.
I invite all of you who have supported POSCO E&C so generously
to examine how we are keeping our pledge to stakeholders.
Going forward, we will continue to carry out our
economic, environmental and social responsibilities, and will
maintain an open communication with you so that we grow
as a trusted and respected enterprise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

135,"POSCO Engineering &Construction Co.,Ltd.",3,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders,
We sincerely appreciate your engagement with and
continuous support for POSCO E&C.
Based on our experience in engineering and construction,
which created the world¡¯s leading steel mills, POSCO E&C has
continued to expand into project planning, financing, engineering,
and management of our core business in steel, national
infrastructure, environment, urban development, and
construction, and developing ourselves into a global EPC Developer.
The year 2014 marked the 20th anniversary of POSCO E&C¡¯s
foundation. Despite the challenging global business environment,
POSCO E&C emerged as one of the top three construction
companies in Korea, exceeding KRW 10 trillion in orders
for the fifth consecutive year. We have become an industry
leader in safety management with low accident rate of 0.08%
as well. Our accomplishments were made possible, thanks to
the support of all our respected stakeholders and dedicated
employees who remain committed to the company¡¯s future.
The year 2015 poses new obstacles as we look towards the
future. Overall investment activities have decreased due to
historically low oil prices and unstable currency market. To
deal with business difficulties, POSCO E&C has created growth
engines to ensure sustainable growth and help overcome
challenges by reforming management in all sectors, including
¡°expanding new orders¡±, ¡°upgrading the capability to manage
projects¡±, and ¡°focusing on Economic Value Added (EVA) and
cash flows¡±.
In the face of these challenges, the Public Investment Fund
(PIF), the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, has become
our second largest shareholder with a 38% share. Through the
opportunity, and PIF will incorporate a joint venture in Saudi
Arabia to establish a foundation for a greater leap. We will
seize more foundations for new opportunities. In addition,
strengthening our corporate governance up to reinforced
global standards will ensure the confidence of our stakeholders
and enhance management efficiency.
POSCO E&C continues to strongly focus on fulfilling our corporate
social responsibility. We place top priority on safety
and sustainable eco-friendly management for conservation
of environment in all aspects of our business.
We are engaged in multiple community outreach activities
both domestically and overseas, including cultural and medical
volunteer work, and working towards improvements in
schools and living conditions for the disadvantaged in Korea
and the rest of the world. Our employees volunteer to put
their time, effort and work experience and expertise together
and engage in raising social awareness.
POSCO E&C has achieved a tremendous growth over the last
twenty years. We are taking our twentieth anniversary as an
opportunity to reflect upon our milestones and reform our
fundamentals in order to advance for a better, brighter future
that can contribute towards the evolution of our society.
We ask for your continued support and encouragement for
our journey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
553,"POSCO Engineering &Construction Co.,Ltd.",4,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders,
Ever since its foundation, POSCO E&C has achieved an average
annual growth rate of 12% by adapting forward-thinking
strategies and developing breakthrough technologies, thereby
attaining the country's top-tier position as a total solution provider
in the construction industry within a very short period of time.
Most notably, the company succeeded in attracting investment
from the Public Investment Fund (PIF), a state-owned fund of
Saudi Arabia, in 2015. Through this transformative shift, the
company was able to not only reform its governance to meet
international standards but also to lay the basis for its remarkable
expansion into the global engineering and construction market.
However, the overseas construction market faces increased
competition among multinational companies from Europe, USA,
and China. The domestic market also faces stagnant growth of
the construction industry as well as economic uncertainty, which
forecast challenges for the sustainable growth of POSCO E&C.
In order to address such a rapidly changing environment and to
grow as a global E&C company which creates consistent value,
POSCO E&C will strive to innovate its management and to foster
new growth engines.
First, we will strengthen the foundations for global
growth leveraging our technical expertise and network.
POSCO E&C will continue to foster technological advancement
and broaden its breadth of business in diverse regions. The
company's technological excellence had been acknowledged in
a number of key markets in Asia, South America and Eastern
Europe. Focusing on these key markets, POSCO E&C will establish
efficient business execution systems, through coordination with
strong business partners and acquisition of local talents, in order to
outlay a stable growth foundation for continuous project awards.
In pursuing new market penetration, POSCO E&C will utilize
its global network established through the presence of POSCO
affiliates in 60 countries around the world. In addition,
the company will create various business opportunities in
collaboration with other industry leaders and local partners,
and identify business opportunities by strengthening its global
sourcing capabilities. Furthermore, POSCO E&C will adapt various
procurement methods, to enhance its global competitiveness in
winning business orders.
POSCO E&C will create social values through
ethics management.
POSCO E&C will engage in all management activities
understanding its social responsibilities, exercising transparent
and unprejudiced ethics management culture, and contribute in
building social value through communication and collaboration
with various stakeholders.
Through 'the Plus' Organizational Culture Campaign, which
launched last June, POSCO E&C will create a culture that practices
the values of ¡®Performance Plus for organizations, Initiative Plus
for leaders, Loyalty Plus for employees and Happiness Plus for
customers'. In addition, POSCO E&C will continue to engage
in various community service activities for the underprivileged
and the future generations, both domestic and abroad and
actively invest its best efforts to resolve issues faced by the local
communities and contribute in their development.
POSCO E&C practices safety management with life
as its priority value and will continue its growth as
environmentally responsible company.
Safety is fundamental at all business sites. The employees of POSCO
E&C and its stakeholders will pre-empt safety risks and establish an
environment that puts safety first. Furthermore, POSCO E&C will
nurture the development of environmental technology and adapt
the expertise to realize eco-friendly construction.
POSCO E&C supports HSE management of its business partners,
providing ample assistance in establishing relative management
systems.
The perpetual growth of POSCO E&C over the last twenty
years was made possible thanks to the continuous interest
and endorsement of its stakeholders; especially the dedicated
employees who work at project sites around the world. To return
its obligation and realize the highest ideals of the stakeholders,
POSCO E&C will continue to invest its utmost efforts to transform
as a global E&C leader, diligently carrying out its corporate social
responsibility and role.
I look forward to your continuous support, guidance and
encouragement.
Thank you very much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,Pulmuone,2,Korea,"Pulmuone continued its profitable growth last year, overcoming various challenges in both domestic and
overseas economic environments. With meaningful financial performances such as KRW 1.52 trillion in sales
and KRW 46 billion in operating profit, Pulmuone has laid the foundation to grow into a global ¡®small giant¡¯
company.
Marking its 30th anniversary in coming May, Pulmuone has established itself as the most representative food
company of Korea by faithfully practicing sustainability management since its inception and growing its
products into the most trusted and loved brands of Korea.
Now Pulmuone readies itself for another great leap forward to become a true global company that spreads the
value of authentic wholesome foods and LOHAS principles, building on its remarkable achievements for the
past 30 years and placing itself firmly not just in Korea but also on the global stage.
Being the 1st food company in Korea that joined the UN Global Compact in 2007, Pulmuone has also
upheld and championed the values and goals expressed in the UNGC¡¯s 10 principles for human rights, labor,
environment and anti-corruption.
Above all, the company is deeply committed to fair and transparent management for sustainability.
TISO(Trust, Integrity, Solidarity, Openness) management principles have been in place to create an
environment that firmly supports fair and transparent business practices. Every year, employees across the
company receive TISO trainings to learn more about corporate core values and write a pledge to practice TISO.
And last year, Pulmuone opened an interactive communication channel named ¡®Talk to CEO¡¯ at the corporate
groupware system as a window to relay employee opinions to the management and share Pulmuone¡¯s mission
and core values across the company.
Pulmuone introduced eco-friendly packaging film last year that minimizes residual chemicals for all types of
its tofu. In addition, the Eumseong tofu plant installed wood pallet boilers burning renewable energy only,
significantly reducing its carbon emissions.
Meanwhile, the Chuncheon plant was designated as Green Company by the Ministry of Environment,
highly recognized for its notable achievement in improving water quality, saving water and energy used in its
production process. The plant invested 13% of its facility investment expenditure to enhance the environment.
It plans to increase its green spending to 15% by next year.
Pulmuone completed the construction of its 1st passive house(a house with the minimum carbon energy usage
per 3.3§³) in Korea to be used as a training venue by the LOHAS Academy located in Goisan, Chungcheongbukdo.
The new eco-friendly building has adopted the latest energy-saving engineering technology developed by
Germany to minimize carbon emissions as it is designed not to use any fossil fuels. Going forward, the passive
house will play a pivotal role in spreading Pulmuone¡¯s mission and vision while bringing the LOHAS spirit to
life.
Since last year, Pulmuone has also been proactively practicing CSV(Corporate Shared Value) to create values
for communities through its business activities while at the same time continuing its CSR(Corporate Social
Responsibility) activities by committing itself to ¡®love for neighbors¡¯ and ¡®respect for life¡¯.
As part of its traditional CSR programs, LOHAS Designer, an employee club for community service, formed 51
volunteering teams to reach out to the underprivileged and social welfare centers in communities.
Pulmuone has also consistently pushed ahead with Authentic Wholesome Foods Campaign, the most
representative CSV initiatives of the company. In 2013, a total of 9,113 people received the authentic wholesome
foods education through 387 sessions. The educational training, which once covered preschoolers and primary
school students only, has now been extended to nursery school teachers and parents. The authentic wholesome
foods campaign is changing dietary habits of Koreans by raising awareness about the importance of food
ingredient labels, nutritional balance and taste education, and teaching how to practice a healthier lifestyle
including the low-sodium and low-sugar diet to lower carbohydrate and sugar intake that can easily turn into
glucose in our bodies.
Thankfully, our efforts for sustainability management are being recognized and highly commended by others.
For instance, Pulmuone has become the 1st food company to rank No. 1 on the KSI(Korea Sustainability Index).
The KSI has been developed by the Korea Standards Association to evaluate social responsibility performance
and sustainability of 180 companies of Korea in 45 industries based on ISO 26000, the official standards for
social responsibility businesses across the world should aspire to. Pulmuone was also included in the allstar
group of ¡®The most respected companies in Korea¡¯ for 8 years in a row, and named as one of the top 100
GWP(great work places) of Korea for 4 consecutive years.
Respectable shareholders, consumers,
our partners and stakeholders of communities!
Marking the 30th anniversary of its existence, Pulmuone people will commit themselves with passion to
developing Pulmuone further into a global ¡®small giant¡¯ which successfully carves out its place in the global
market without making the mistake of falling into complacency. Please join us with your encouragement and
support in our journey toward a truly global LOHAS company. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
505,Pulmuone,4,Korea,"Dear valued stakeholders, It gives me a great pleasure to publish 2015 Integrated Report, the 10th sustainability report of Pulmuone, which includes more detailed and enhanced sales and financial performance data as a follow-up to the previous year¡¯s change to include financial performance data in the sustainability report. Pulmuone has championed sustainability management from early on. It is the very 1st food company in Korea to report its commitment toward sustainability, publishing its 1st sustainability report in 2006 following the international standards to better communicate its efforts for sustainability to stakeholders. In its 1st sustainability report, Pulmuone stated ¡®we have worked for the environment and communities by fulfilling our roles to love neighbors and respect life. We publish this report to show our ongoing commitment to a healthy environment and social responsibility in the process of pursuing economic profit.¡¯ From then on, Pulmuone has published the sustainability report every year, and this year, the report celebrates the 10th anniversary of its birth. Pulmuone¡¯s sustainability report has continued its growth and evolution for the past decade together with the company itself, communicating to the stakeholders its business status, TISO management principles, social responsibility and environment protection. Last year, Pulmuone changed the report format to include detailed financial performances of its subsidiaries and affiliates and renamed it as ¡®Annual Report¡¯. This year, the report goes through another evolution by adding its sales and financial performance data to its contents to be renamed as ¡®Integrated Report¡¯. This year¡¯s report also captured Pulmuone¡¯s activities and business strategy designed to attain the SDGs adopted in the UN General Assembly in September 2015 to charter a better future for the humanity and the earth. I hope the newly changed format of the report can serve as more effective guide for stakeholders to understand both financial (including the sales data) and non-financial performances of sustainability management. Different business units recorded hugely different performances last year due to the impact of the MERS outbreak and the global recession. Amidst such difficulties, however, Pulmuone achieved a meaningful result. Its total revenue(KRW 1.85 trillion) increased 10.0% from the previous year with its business units in the domestic market posting a sustained growth. But for overseas businesses, it was the stage to lay the foundation for a future growth. I believe 2016 will be the year Pulmuone has a great leap forward to grow into a global company, building on its sustainable management practices with its sales reaching KRW 2 trillion. Pulmuone is firmly committed to TISO Management. TISO, which stands for Trust, Integrity, Solidarity, Openness, is Pulmuone¡¯s core value to ensure healthy life of consumers and sustainability of the Earth. Pulmuone is practicing fair and transparent management in compliance with TISO principles in every aspect of its business. In parallel with this, the company has been also advocating the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact for human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption since 2007. Pulmuone is championing green management to promote sustainability in its business management. Green management is about fashioning strategy to protect the environment throughout its business process from production to distribution and consumption by designing its production facilities, products and services in an eco-friendly manner, cutting carbon emissions and communicating with consumers more efficiently. Such strategy of Pulmuone is closely aligned with three of the 17 UN SDGs such as sustainable consumption and production, climate change response and ecosystem preservation. Pulmuone will continue its utmost effort to achieve the aims and reduce the carbon emissions by incorporating this drive into its business plan. Pulmuone has a mission to be ¡®a LOHAS company that cares for both humans and nature¡¯. The LOHAS value is constantly evolving, expanding its concept from offering good foods at first to include the LOHAS diet and more recently, LOHAS lifestyle company. This year, Pulmuone¡¯s LOHAS concept crossed a crucial turning point. It used to focus on low GL diet and nutritional balance when developing LOHAS products and services in the past, but starting from this year, Pulmuone plans to take into account potential carbon emissions when it develops products since the LOHAS lifestyle can be enabled better in a clean environment. This is ¡®LOHAS Diet Model¡¯ which benchmarks ¡®the double food and environmental pyramid¡¯ of overseas companies in the product and service development stage in order to enhance sustainability of health and environment. Moreover, Pulmuone¡¯s social responsibility is evolving continuously to include CSV activities which create economic and social values at the same time. Pulmuone¡¯s CSV activities which have the authentic wholesome foods campaign at the center are now expanding its scope to include ¡®LOHAS Diet¡¯ campaign for parents and ¡®LOHAS Lifestyle¡¯ campaign for children promoting clean classrooms for students. Thanks to such endeavor, Pulmuone has been designated as one of the most respected companies in Korea for 10 years in a row, ranked as the 1st food company in KSI(Korea Sustainability Index) and named as one of the ¡®100 GWPs(Great Work Place) of Korea for six consecutive years. The recognition doesn¡¯t stop here: Pulmuone is the only food company in Korea to be chosen for three consecutive years by ¡®East Asia 30¡¯ which evaluates companies renowned for outreach initiatives in Korea, China and Japan, and enjoyed the honor of being awarded by the ¡®Korean Good company¡¯ for two consecutive years.
Respected shareholders,
Consumers and stakeholders!

We, all employees of Pulmuone, will make our utmost efforts to have Pulmuone go beyond Korea to become a world-class sustainable company recognized across the globe. Thank you.

139,Samsung,2,Korea,"As you well know, our industry was confronted with numerous challenges during 2013: There was
continued uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, and a delayed economic recovery in Europe. Coupled
with currency volatility and weak consumer sentiment in Korea and many emerging markets,
these economic factors created a difficult and complicated business environment. However, as a
result of our employees¡¯ passion and dedication, Samsung Electronics managed to achieve record
revenues and profits? further solidifying our position as a global electronics leader.
Samsung Electronics is focused not only on relentless technological innovation and maximizing
shareholder value; we also want to become a leader in corporate citizenship and strengthen our interaction
with customers, local communities and stakeholders. We see it as our responsibility to help
enhance the quality of life for the people we serve and the local communities in which we operate,
and to share our progress in achieving these goals. In our Sustainability Report for 2014, I would like
to share with you our most recent achievements as well as our vision for the future.
First and foremost, we have focused our efforts on pursuing sustainable and positive growth. That is
the path toward achieving our ¡®Vision 2020¡¯: we want to inspire the world with innovative technologies,
products and designs ? in order to enrich peoples¡¯ lives while contributing to a socially responsible
future. We consider creativity to be the seed of innovation and as such invest in a wide range
of initiatives and programs that foster the creative spirit and autonomy of our employees across
the company. This report will show you the many different forms these initiatives take, from our
expanded C-Lab (Creative Lab) ? an initiative where the company provides personnel and budget to
support projects proposed by employees - to our flexible work schedule and the Idea Open Space.
During the past year we also sought to enhance our capabilities to manage and detect risk.
For Samsung Electronics to see continued growth, it is essential that we have the ability to respond
promptly to uncertainties and risks in our business environment. Already we hold our manufacturing
facilities to the highest labor and environmental regulations worldwide. This year, we also
strengthened supplier compliance by reinforcing our Code of Conduct and actively monitoring and
managing our dynamic supply chain. Samsung has one top priority: To ensure the health and safety
of our employees and the communities where we operate. We are focused not only on improving
our processes for promptly dealing with accidents, but we also established precautionary measures;
for example, we established a direct management system for hazardous substances ? thus improving
the safety of our facilities and increasing the number of people dedicated to prevent future accidents.
We now have over 2,000 highly-trained Samsung employees who oversee factory operations
and conduct regular inspections; among them are experts and engineers who are specialists in
ensuring chemical safety and preventing accidentsAs a responsible corporate citizen, Samsung is sharply aware of the growing environmental impact
associated with the sourcing, manufacturing, use, and disposal of our products. Our Green Management
philosophy, which prioritizes the future health of our people and our planet and mandates
environmentally responsible practices throughout our operations, drives our environmental sustainability
initiatives. Let me give you one example: As part of our eco-design process, we consider the
environmental impact of new products during their whole development cycle. We implemented this
philosophy in 2009, and since then Samsung has invested 6.6 trillion KRW (6.3 billion USD) in sustainability
efforts ? resulting in a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and over 3,300
third-party verified product environmental certifications.
As I mentioned, we see it as our responsibility to help enhance the quality of life for the people we
serve and the local communities in which we operate. It is in this spirit that Samsung invests more
than 500 billion KRW (384.4 million USD) globally to support our citizenship and community engagement
activities. While we are incredibly proud of the support we provide, Samsung Electronics
is adopting a rigorous and more consistent long-term approach to our activities, which are focused
on education, health/medical care, employment and the economies of local communities.
We delivered many projects during 2013, but I want to highlight just five major social initiatives that
were tailored for local needs: the Smart School, the Nanum Villages, Samsung Care Drive, Solve for
Tomorrow, and the Samsung Tech Institute. Our support is not only financial; every year nearly 70
percent of our global workforce participates in volunteer activities in local markets.
Finally, Samsung Electronics continues to reinvent itself around one key concept: reinvesting the
dividends of our work into the growth of our company and the communities we serve. We will use
this Sustainability Report as a compass. It allows us to reflect on past efforts and assists us in achieving
maximum impact in the future.
I look forward to your continued trust and support in our endeavors to create a more sustainable
society. Thank you..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
555,Samsung,4,Korea,"I sincerely appreciate your continued support of Samsung
Electronics.
Although we have experienced many challenges while in the
midst of rapid changes throughout global markets and the
business environment over the past few years, we have overcome
all of them through our bold initiatives and innovation.
At Samsung, we believe our consistent growth is due to our
employees, suppliers, and customers. In fact, during this difficult
time our employees have worked with unbridled enthusiasm,
while our suppliers have been nothing short of great
partners and exhibited a win-win spirit. At the same time,
customers have continued to express their affection for the
company.
Samsung aims to fulfill its social responsibility as a corporate
global citizen as well as carry out business activities to maximize
the company¡¯s profit and shareholder value. To this end,
we have established an approach to major sustainability management
as follows.
First of all, we will continue to monitor global trends in today¡¯s
rapidly changing business environment as we identify new
risks and opportunities. Based on this approach, we will examine
what aspects of our company are not yet satisfactory.
We will also prudently recognize where we are as a company
before deciding on our future approach, thereby establishing
an effective sustainability management strategy.
We are committed to taking part in global initiatives with our
stakeholders and exploring improvement measures through
joint efforts. A company with a complicated supply chain system
like Samsung needs to carry through with joint initiatives
alongside its various stakeholders, which include other companies
in the same industry, governments from around the world,
international organizations, and NGOs.
Finally, we will examine key performance indicators (KPIs)
related to sustainability management to create a synergistic
effect as we pursue economic and social values together. Furthermore,
we sympathize with the direction of UN¡¯s Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) and we will work to align our
business activities with this framework.
In 2015, we expressed our determination to pursue responsible
business activities by disclosing our newly established
Business Conduct Guidelines as promises to be implemented
by the company and all its employees. In 2016, we have listened
to our many stakeholders in order to complement these
guidelines, and have improved policies in the field of labor and
human rights.
As we move forward, Samsung will continue to fulfill its social
responsibility based on the company¡¯s business philosophy of
creating superior products and services, thereby contributing
to a greater global society.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,Samsung Asset Management,1,Korea,"It is my great pleasure to greet our valued shareholders and other
stakeholders through this sustainability report, the first of its kind
published by Samsung Asset Management.
Innovation and Growth Towards Global Top-class Standards
The year 2012 was a time of trials for the Korean financial industry
but that of many returns for Samsung Asset Management. In the
year, we posted KRW 119.4 trillion, the industry's largest assets
under management, and rolled out many innovative investment
products, setting industry trends and reaffirming our stature as
Korea's leading asset manager. In particular, we led the domestic
ETF market by listing short-term fixed income ETF, the MSCI Korea
ETF, and other innovative investment products. In recognition for
our unrivaled earnings performance, we were praised by a host
of respected industry journals and observers as Korea¡¯s best asset
manager in a wide range of categories.
In 2013, we will continue dominating the domestic funds market
by strengthening our business competitiveness and enhancing
management efficiencies. By 2016, we will establish Samsung Asset
Management as the industry leader not only in scale but also in
profit, return rates, and other aspects that matter to stakeholders.
We will shift our marketing focus to highlighting the outstanding
features of our channels in an effort to make them more competitive.
We will build up our product development competency to roll out
products in step with market change ahead of our competitors.
We will also take steps to fortify our standing in the passive
investment market, enhance flagship funds, and increase assets
under management in our overseas business.
Laying a Foundation for Sustainable Operations
Sustainable operations hinge on internal systems progressing
forward in harmony with one another. Which is why we are
increasingly stepping up efforts to fully comply with all business
laws and industry guidelines, root out corruption, and foster a
decision-making mindset that puts compliance before profit. By
fostering a corporate culture where diligence, transparency, and
fairness matter, we will stay focused on sustainable operations.
Human resources make up a core asset as well as a competitive
edge in the financial services business. In fact, it is the talented
and dedicated individuals who can see a crisis form in the distance
amid the turmoil of market developments and take preparatory
actions to capitalize on the emerging opportunity. Hence, we
remain committed to developing human recourses and thus arm
ourselves with cutting-edge knowledge and techniques so that
we become the most proficient in asset management. To help our
people become the best in their professions and attract specialists
with proven track records, we will adopt ambitious HR training
programs, and improve the personnel system to global standards.
Social Responsibility in Asset Management
Since the last global financial crisis, calls demanding that financial
institutions take on bigger social responsibilities have grown
louder. Accordingly, after pondering the roles we should play as an
industry leader in pursuit of sustainable operations, we concluded
that leading the sustainable development of society through
socially responsible investments and meaningful financial support
should be the core of our social responsibility. Socially responsible
investments, in particular, are issues that are increasingly gaining
attention across the world. While basing our investment decisions
on the ethical, social, and environmental consequences they would
entail, we will continue to explore ways to develop new funds such
as water and new renewable energy funds that can contribute to
the prevention of climate changes and solving water shortage
problems around the world. Another issue high on our to-do list is
providing funding support to promising small and medium-sized
enterprises in need of operating capital.
Equipped with investment expertise, unsurpassed core competencies,
and sound possibilities for sustainable operations, we will
carry out social responsibilities to our best ability and give full
attention to the voices of our stakeholders. With a deep gratitude
for having made us what we are today, I look forward to your
continued support in the coming years.
Thank you,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,Samsung Asset Management,2,Korea,"Dear Valued Stakeholders,
It is my great pleasure to greet our valued stakeholders through this
sustainability report once again; and I thank you for the unwavering support
you have given Samsung Asset Management over the years.
As you probably know well, the US funds market shows signs of steady
recovery on the strengths of IT, shale gas, and other new industries taking
advantage of a stable monetary policy. In contrast, the domestic market
fluctuates within limits, wearing out investors¡¯ confidence and fueling their
flight to safety. In fact, the growing concentration of investments in mediumrisk-
medium-return products, asset allocation-type vehicles, and hedge
funds has created an environment that will have repercussions on financial
investment institutions for a long time to come.
Progressively Responding to Dynamic Market Changes
Against such market developments we have taken a number of initiatives
through which we have achieved some of the industry¡¯s best results: as
of July 2014, KRW 125 trillion in assets under management and KRW 42
trillion in sales. The ¡°Samsung US Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund¡±, which
pursues long-term stable returns through proactive allocation of assets into
US equity and US fixed income securities, has become a big hit. A series
of hedge funds we have developed over the past 12 months average 1%
in monthly rates of return, contributing a great deal to the stability of the
fledgling Korean hedge funds market. In the ETF space where we have the
upper hand over our competition, we have set a KRW 10 trillion milestone
through the expansion of the product line-up and the improvement of
customer service. We also have been reappointed as the lead manager
of the National Pension Services¡¯ ¡°Investment Pool¡±; a testament to our
unchallenged knowhow in generating stable returns on the pool¡¯s assets.
Satisfactory as these achievements may be, we will continue to push
ourselves towards higher goals; we will pursue better performance results
through thorough risk management, proactively respond to market changes,
and actively expand into the overseas markets.
Continuing Internal Innovation Towards Sustainable Growth
In addition to external growth, we step up efforts to realize sustainable
growth through internal innovation. To strengthen our research
competencies, we have separated the research team from the equity
investments division and elevated it to a position of research center
reporting directly to the CEO. Staffed with the industry¡¯s best and brightest
analysts with an average work experience of 15 years, the center is expected
to play a critical role in executing our investment philosophy of generating
stable returns on all of our customer assets. Thus armed with the industry¡¯s
first-rate research prowess, we plan to make inroads into the alternative
investment market by creating a task force dedicated to the development of
new businesses and finally the acquisition of future growth engines.
Financial products entail risk in proportion to the rates of return they seek,
which is why customers must be informed of every detail of products and
the risks involved, thus preempting the risk of loss through unnecessary
exposure. Fully committed to the protection of financial customer rights, we
maintain a strict compliance system through which we manage and control
all of our investment information materials, fund performance reports,
and other product publications, to make sure our customers have a clear
understanding of what to expect from their investments. In recognition of
our dedication to customer rights, we were named by the Korea Financial
Investment Association (KOFIA) an outstanding asset manager in the area of
compliance in 2013.
Effort Towards Sustainable Investments
In addition, in pursuit of decent returns on behalf of our customers, asset
management must contribute to the global village in the economic, social,
environmental and other aspects. Not only to generate stable returns on
customer assets through employment of advanced investment knowhow
but also to help build a better world through development of products
and services that are socially responsible are the tasks we execute with
dedication and excellence. The ¡°Samsung Korea New Growth Industry Fund¡±
invests in industries expected to be at the forefront of Korean economic
growth in the future; the ¡°Samsung Global Clean Energy Fund¡± and the
¡°Samsung Global Water Fund¡± both invest in industries offering solutions
to global problems arising from climate change and water shortages; and
the ¡°Retirement Planning Solutions¡± guarantee baby boomers a financiallysecured
post-retirement life.
Last but not least, Samsung Life Insurance has become our majority
shareholder effective August 2014. This strategic alliance is, among many
things, to maximize synergies between one of the most respected brands
wielding the most extensive channel networks in Korea and an asset
management power armed with the industry¡¯s best product lineup. In
addition to developing innovative overseas equity and fixed income products
through the global network of the New York, London, and Hong Kong
subsidiaries, the alliance is expected to help us achieve tangible results in
superb long-term products, PEFs and other new businesses; in particular,
we look forward towards developing, together with the life insurance giant,
asset allocation products that are in sync with low-interest, low-growth, and
ageing trends.
Armed with investment expertise and unsurpassed product competiveness
and backed by Korea¡¯s most trusted name in insurance, we will relentlessly
strive towards sustainable growth through constant innovation of the way
we think and work and proactive adaptation to market changes. Moreover,
paying closer attention to the voices of our stakeholders, we will continue to
practice ethical, transparent, and socially-responsible management every
step of the way. With a deep gratitude for having made us what we are today,
I look forward to your continued support in the coming years.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,Samsung C&T,1,Korea,"I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to our stakeholders for the unwavering trust and
support you have shown us over the years. The looming threat of a further decline in the global
economy is casting a long shadow over the company¡¯s business environment, highlighting the
uncertainty we will have to endure for the near future. Samsung C&T Corporation has persevered
during this tough economic climate, however, developing new markets and expanding our
value chain has forced the company to reinvent itself. As a result, Samsung C&T Corporation has
transformed itself into an enduring business with sustainable growth potential, while also
restructuring its businesses and improving operational competencies within the global market.
Through these efforts, the company was able to realize KRW25.3 trillion in sales and KRW13.7
trillion in new orders in 2012. Without the hard work and sacrifice of our people, as well as the
continued support and interest we have received from you, we would not have achieved such
remarkable results.Samsung C&T Corporation has established and implemented a number of diverse activities
within sustainable management in an effort to create a positive impact on the environment and
society. Supported by our environmental management system, which has been designed to
align with the global standard, we conduct an assessment on the environmental impact of our
construction projects throughout the entire lifecycle, while taking into account such factors as
efficient use of resources and energy, protection of the ecosystem, and the reduction of greenhouse
gases. We also strive to create an opportunity for high value-added businesses by
developing efficient energy management techniques for buildings through a leadership role in
the K-MEG (Korea Micro Energy Grid) R&D Project. We are strengthening our preventive health,
safety, and environmental management capabilities through the development of an accident
prevention model unique to Samsung that is firmly rooted in the reverence for life, as well as the
publication of risk assessment templates. We are doing our utmost to earn the trust of our
constituents through the implementation of sustainable health, safety, and environmental
management systems that are aligned with global standards.
Samsung C&T Corporation can only be as good as its partners. That¡¯s why we respect and treat
our suppliers like true business partners. This enables our company to promote shared growth
in management through the implementation of the Fair Trade Compliance Program, and other
support programs in technology, finance, education, and training. We also assist our partner
companies with their sustainable management processes by adopting programs such as the
Green Management Expansion Project. In addition, the company is conducting a global expert
training program in order to enhance our global competencies and the expertise of our employees.
We¡¯re also promoting the formation of a unique organizational culture by actively involving
our employees in a variety of engaging activities that are designed to stimulate and enhance the
flow of internal communications and interactions.
Samsung C&T Corporation will not rest on its laurels. We are committed to our growth as a
leading global company and are keen to accomplish an equally recognizable performance in our
Engineering & Construction and Trading & Investment businesses. In support of this, we will
continue to develop market-leading global products, expand business areas across the entire
value chain, and implement a more enhanced risk management strategy, while expanding our
management infrastructure required to support our ambitious goals. Going forward, I invite you
to keep a close eye on the activities and performance of Samsung C&T Corporation, which will
continue to strengthen our relationship with society through our sustainable management
efforts and active communication with stakeholders. We are always ready to listen to your
feedback on our performance.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,Samsung C&T,2,Korea,"I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to
you, our valued stakeholders, for your immense
support and continuous trust in us.
Despite the enduring global economic downturn
in 2013, Samsung C&T marked meaningful
achievements in its construction and trading
businesses over the past year. The company¡¯s
Engineering & Construction Group achieved
more than $12.6 billion in annual overseas orders,
a record amount for a Korean construction
company. In addition, the company¡¯s Trading
& Investment Group won an order for the
construction and operation of a power plant
in Chile¡¯s power generation market, which had
been dominated by leading global companies,
the first time a Korean company had done so,
thereby successfully opening a new market.
Such achievements are the result of concerted efforts made by our people at Samsung C&T to deliver the best value to
our customers and society.
With the impact of corporate activities on stakeholders and society gradually expanding, the values a company should
pursue are no longer confined merely to financial ones. Now, a company should be able to deliver positive value not only
to its diverse stakeholders, including its employees, partner companies, customers, and local communities, but also to
society as a whole.
Samsung C&T is engaged in an extensive range of CSR initiatives to become a company trusted by its stakeholders and
society, as well as to create value for the company. Our key social responsibility activities include efficient use of resources
and energy based on our global-standard environmental management system; enhancement of the support system for
shared growth with our partner companies; and social contribution activities tailored to the needs of local sites and overseas
locations. In particular, as ethical management and safety management are matters that receive immense attention
and high demand from society, including our stakeholders, we at Samsung C&T recognize their importance and make
continuous investment and efforts in actively implementing them in every activity we are involved in.
Our valued stakeholders,
We hope that you will maintain your support for Samsung C&T, while keeping a close eye on the various activities we are
engaged in to create not only the company¡¯s value, but also sustainable values for society in general.

I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to all our stakeholders for your
support and continued interest.
In today¡¯s business landscape where corporate social responsibility has
emerged as an integral part of the corporate concept, companies are called
upon to take on a role that goes beyond profit-seeking and maximizing financial
gain.
In order for a company to thrive today and in the future, it should engage in
sustainability management activities that in order to reposition itself as an
enterprise trusted and respected by its stakeholders and society.
In 2014, with the firm belief in corporate social responsibility, we undertook
systematic activities in various sustainability management areas.
The Trading and Investment Group introduced a set of safety rules for accident
prevention, diagnosed the safety environment and made improvements
to ensure effective management of worker health and safety protection. We also streamlined our dedicated compliance team
and performed proactive monitoring to foster a sound compliance culture where every member of the organization abides by the
rules and principles. In our relations with customers, we strived to strengthen cooperative ties we have built with our customers by
delivering the information they want and need and exploring joint venture opportunities. We, on the HR front, focused on nurturing
global experts and creating an enjoyable organizational culture, while continuously pursuing shared growth with local communities
by supporting children from multicultural families and engaging in volunteer activities with overseas customers.
The Engineering and Construction Group adopted a culture of ¡®safety first¡¯ putting safety at the center of our organization. We have
responded to the global threat of climate change by enhancing the application of green technology, GHG emissions reduction and
energy management systems. We have added new communication channels for better client support and increased efforts to prosper
together with our partners. We have encouraged voluntary activities to promote a culture of ethics and compliance and practiced CSR
in our business activities. At the same time, we continued our efforts to secure and nurture highly qualified global employees who are
key to the company¡¯s competitiveness as a global player.
In recognition of these efforts, Samsung C&T has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) becoming the
first trading and distribution sector firm to make the list in Korea. We have also received the highest score from the prestigious environment
protection initiative, the Carbon Disclosure Project(CDP), and earned a position on their 2014 Climate Performance Leadership
Index.
In contrast to these achievements, we also had a tragic accident on one of our overseas sites, which served as a wake-up call for the
company. I, on behalf of all members of Samsung C&T, extend my deepest sympathies to those affected by the tragic accident, and
assure you that we will reinforce our efforts to prevent the recurrence of such an event and provide a safer work environment.
In 2015 Samsung C&T will further solidify the framework for sustainable business management in a bid to reinvent itself as a truly globalized
company. We will promote a wide range of activities that our customers, employees and local communities can all appreciate.
Samsung C&T remains committed to the vision of becoming a trusted corporate citizen, fostering long-term relationships built on
mutual respect and creating co-prosperity with our partners and stakeholders.
Dear stakeholders,
We hope that you will continue to support and encourage us in our journey to create sustainable value for our shareholders and the
communities we serve.

Second, we will increase our CSR risk management
capability and future competitiveness for sustainable
growth. We are well aware of the responsibilities we
carry as a global corporate citizen and we will continue to
establish business operation systems that consider people
and the environment throughout our entire value chain.
Third, we will create synergy across our business groups

146,Samsung Electronics,1,Korea,"Dear Stakeholders,
It has been twenty years since Samsung Electronics executed a series
of turnaround strategies that have fundamentally changed the way we
manage our business.
During the past two decades, Samsung Electronics has emerged as a
leader in the IT industry, not only in terms of global sales but also in sustainability.
This Samsung Electronics Sustainability Report for 2013 provides
a comprehensive look at our efforts in environmental and social
responsibility, from stories on our past successes to a focused vision for
our future.
The business environment in 2012 was tough for us just as it was for
many others. However, Samsung has been able to successfully navigate
the challenges of 2012¡¯s global IT marketplace and economy. This past
year saw Samsung Electronics record its largest annual growth and operating
profits in its corporate history, further strengthening our leadership
position in the global electronics industry. In 2012, external recognition
of our company¡¯s value also continued to rise, as Samsung Electronics
ranked 20th on the list of Fortune Global 500 Companies and 9th in Interbrand¡¯s
Best Global Brands Report. The corporate value of Samsung
Electronics skyrocketed all around the globe.
Above all else, these successes are due to the hard work and expertise
of Samsung Electronics¡¯ employees, whose collaborative efforts enhance
our company¡¯s competitiveness and accelerate innovation. There can
also be no doubt that our company¡¯s achievements in 2012 would have
been impossible without the keen interest and full support of all of our
stakeholders like you.
Let me take this opportunity, then, to extend my deepest gratitude to all
of you for your great contributions to our company¡¯s accomplishments in
2012. I can personally assure you that Samsung Electronics will regard our
success as an asset that positions us for future growth and realize our Vision
2020 plan and become a leader in corporate citizenship.
To that end, let me share with you some highlights of Samsung¡¯s sustainability
efforts in 2012, specifically in terms of our contributions to both
society and the environment.
Under our philosophy of ¡®People First,¡¯ Samsung continued to hire
great people around the globe who are the best and brightest in their
field. Samsung took a variety of measures to make itself a world-class
workplace. Samsung Electronics took great care to develop and foster
a workplace environment that assured our workers¡¯ health and safety.
One highlight includes a program through hospitals, through which we
offered various physical and mental health services to our employees.
These services include onsite stop-smoking clinics, counseling centers
and fitness facilities.
Samsung is also committed to using our resources to help communities
in need. One of our most exemplary social contributions, the Samsung
Hope for Children program, benefits around 200,000 children and young
adults in the developing world in both education and healthcare and
we will continue to increase our role in creating better lives for children
around the world.
In 2012, in order to ensure the responsible management of our supply
chain, Samsung Electronics intensified the systematic scrutiny of our suppliers
in terms of labor conditions, human rights, and health and safety.
In doing so, we identified key issues with which to measure our suppliers¡¯
compliance ? some of which we took immediate measures to address.
At Samsung Electronics, we view the growing imperative for eco-friendliness
as an opportunity for responsible business leadership. In 2009, we
announced two key sustainability strategies in our 2013 Eco-Management
Plan, namely reduction in GHG emissions and increased eco-product
launches. In 2012, Samsung Electronics exceeded its goals in these
two strategies, whose work consisted of activities in three major areas:
Green Operations, Green Products, and Green Communication.
Through the release of this report, Samsung Electronics hopes to enhance
communication with its stakeholders about the company¡¯s contributions
to the economy, society and the environment. We¡¯d also like to
engage in open discussions with our stakeholders about the challenges
we face while seeking ideas to address them. We firmly believe that a
company can continue to grow only when it maintains its stakeholders¡¯
full trust and collaboration.In order to create value for our stakeholders ? including customers, shareholders,
investors, employees, suppliers and local communities ? Samsung
Electronics has expanded our commitments to social and environmental responsibility,
embedding social contributions and sustainable practices into
our core business. We are always developing new goals to further improve
upon our corporate citizenship and, in turn, helping to create a healthier
global community.
I look forward to your continued trust and support in these endeavors.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,Samsung Electronics,2,Korea,"As you well know, our industry was confronted with numerous challenges during 2013: There was
continued uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, and a delayed economic recovery in Europe. Coupled
with currency volatility and weak consumer sentiment in Korea and many emerging markets,
these economic factors created a difficult and complicated business environment. However, as a
result of our employees¡¯ passion and dedication, Samsung Electronics managed to achieve record
revenues and profits? further solidifying our position as a global electronics leader.
Samsung Electronics is focused not only on relentless technological innovation and maximizing
shareholder value; we also want to become a leader in corporate citizenship and strengthen our interaction
with customers, local communities and stakeholders. We see it as our responsibility to help
enhance the quality of life for the people we serve and the local communities in which we operate,
and to share our progress in achieving these goals. In our Sustainability Report for 2014, I would like
to share with you both our most recent achievements as well as our vision for the future.
First and foremost, we have focused our efforts on pursuing sustainable and positive growth. That is
the path toward achieving our ¡®Vision 2020¡¯: we want to inspire the world with innovative technologies,
products and designs ? in order to enrich peoples¡¯ lives while contributing to a socially responsible
future. We consider creativity to be the seed of innovation and as such invest in a wide range
of initiatives and programs that foster the creative spirit and autonomy of our employees across
the company. This report will show you the many different forms these initiatives take, from our
expanded C-Lab (Creative Lab) ? an initiative where the company provides personnel and budget to
support projects proposed by employees - to our flexible work schedule and the Idea Open Space.
During the past year we also sought to enhance our capabilities to manage and detect risk.
For Samsung Electronics to see continued growth, it is essential that we have the ability to respond
promptly to uncertainties and risks in our business environment. Already we hold our manufacturing
facilities to the highest labor and environmental regulations worldwide. This year, we also
strengthened supplier compliance by reinforcing our Code of Conduct and actively monitoring and
managing our dynamic supply chain. Samsung has one top priority: To ensure the health and safety
of our employees and the communities where we operate. We are focused not only on improving
our processes for promptly dealing with accidents, but we also established precautionary measures;
for example, we established a direct management system for hazardous substances ? thus improving
the safety of our facilities and increasing the number of people dedicated to prevent future accidents.
We now have over 2,000 highly-trained Samsung employees who oversee factory operations
and conduct regular inspections; among them are experts and engineers who are specialists in
ensuring chemical safety and preventing accidents.As a responsible corporate citizen, Samsung is sharply aware of the growing environmental impact
associated with the sourcing, manufacturing, use and disposal of our products. Our Green Management
philosophy, which prioritizes the future health of our people and our planet and mandates
environmentally responsible practices throughout our operations, drives our environmental sustainability
initiatives. Let me give you one example: As part of our eco-design process, we consider the
environmental impact of new products during their whole development cycle. We implemented this
philosophy in 2009, and since then Samsung has invested 6.6 trillion KRW (6.3 billion USD) in sustainability
efforts ? resulting in a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and over 3,300
third-party verified product environmental certifications.
As I mentioned, we see it as our responsibility to help enhance the quality of life for the people we
serve and the local communities in which we operate. It is in this spirit that Samsung invests more
than 500 billion KRW (384.4 million USD) globally to support our citizenship and community engagement
activities. While we are incredibly proud of the support we provide, Samsung Electronics
is adopting a rigorous and more consistent long-term approach to our activities, which are focused
on education, health/medical care, employment and the economies of local communities.
We delivered many projects during 2013, but I want to highlight just five major social initiatives that
were tailored for local needs: the Smart School, the Nanum Villages, Samsung Care Drive, Solve for
Tomorrow and the Samsung Tech Institute. Our support is not only financial; every year nearly 70
percent of our global workforce participates in volunteer activities in local markets.
Finally, Samsung Electronics continues to reinvent itself around one key concept: reinvesting the
dividends of our work into the growth of our company and the communities we serve. We will use
this Sustainability Report as a compass. It allows us to reflect on past efforts and assists us in achieving
maximum impact in the future.
I look forward to your continued trust and support in our endeavors to create a more sustainable
society. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,Samsung Electronics,3,Korea,"Throughout 2014, we faced challenges from changes in our business environments to volatile markets everywhere.
As a result, our sales and profits declined for the first time since the 1997 global financial crisis. However, we remained
optimistic and continued to stay focused on strengthening our competitive position led by our global 320,000 employees.
And we will continue to turn today¡¯s challenges into new foundation for our future growth.
Our management vision has always extended beyond pursuing profit generation and maximizing shareholder values.
As a leading global company, we take social and environmental responsibilities very seriously. We actively communicate with
our stakeholders to collectively address key material social and environmental issues of our time. In particular, we established
the ¡®Business Conduct Guidelines¡¯ this year to further integrate sustainability management throughout the company. And
by announcing it within this 2015 sustainability report, we are demonstrating our unwavering commitment to integrity and
transparency.
This year¡¯s report is organized to highlight our approach to sustainability management in three core areas: ¡®People¡¯, ¡®Society¡¯,
and ¡®Environment¡¯.
First, the ¡®People¡¯ section contains our efforts to improve integrity management, talent development, and workplace
environment. Building on one of the company¡¯s core value ¡®Talent First,¡¯ we recruit and develop the best global talents around
the world and provide a variety of training programs to reach their full potential. Moreover, we make strong efforts to improve
the conditions of our workplace and our suppliers.
Next, the ¡®Society¡¯ section highlights our approach to create sustainable business ecosystem by cultivating responsible business
practices for our suppliers, distribution networks, and customers. In addition, we present our continued efforts to create a better
world through innovation and corporate citizenship programs. In particular, I am proud of our efforts to support our partners
worldwide and promote their competitiveness as we forge mutually benefitting partnerships for shared and sustainable growth.
Third, the ¡®Environment¡¯ section provides an overview of our green mangement which focuses on improving
workplace environment, health and safety management and developing eco-friendly products. Last year,
we increased development of eco-friendly materials and products and reduced GHG emissions to
drive our solutions for climate change.
We at Samsung follow a simple business philosophy: ¡®To devote our talent and technology to
creating superior products and services that contribute to a better global society¡¯. To this end, we
will continue to make every effort to uphold our commitment to connect effectively our technology,
products, and services in ways that improve people¡¯s lives and strengthen society at large.

558,Samsung Electronics,4,Korea,"Dear Domestic and International Stakeholders, who sincerely support and love Samsung
Electro-Mechanics, I send my sincere greetings to you!
Samsung Electro-Mechanics has proactively responded to regulations on climate change and the product environment, managed win-win
cooperation programs with business partners, and has been engaged in various social contribution activities. Driven by such efforts, Samsung
Electro-Mechanics has been listed as the member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for 7 consecutive years since 2009, and has also
been incorporated into the 2015 MSCI Global Sustainability Index.
However, since there has been a forecast of instability in the management environment, due to the recent low growth of the global economy
and the entry of IT products into the stage of maturity, Samsung Electro-Mechanics will initiate its business based on the three activities as
follows in order to respond to market changes and establish a sustainable business structure.
First, we will continue to improve our business structure by securing core competitiveness.
We will expand our differentiated competitiveness through the proactive launch of new products and a higher degree of completion in
development and integration of core components. We will also intensify the business fundamentals through stronger cost competitiveness.
These business competitive edges will help us to scale up our sales in China, proactively tap into new markets, and also improve our business
structure.
Second, we will thoroughly prepare ourselves for the future to achieve sustainable growth.
Samsung Electro-Mechanics is the only components company equipped with technologies for modules, printed circuit boards (PCB s) and
passive components. We will commercialize the next-generation package substrate, which converge Samsung Electro-Mechanics¡¯s exclusive
innovative technologies and engineering know-how to respond to inflection points in technology, utilizing our strengths. The scope of
applications will be valued to incorporate areas with growth potential, including IoT, wearables and automotive, generating opportunities to
move forward.
Lastly, we will ensure that our corporate culture is of the highest order.
Product competitiveness boils down to people¡¯s competitiveness. Therefore, we will establish a corporate culture driven by the endurance of
individual employees to resolve root causes of problems. Our corporate culture will be based on endless communication and collaboration.
While the year 2015 was a period for us to prepare for changes, innovation and challenges, the year 2016 will be a year to crystalize Samsung
Electro-Mechanics¡¯s performance. We will make sure that Samsung Electro-Mechanics has stronger competitiveness by shedding off
unnecessary matters through selection and concentration, and filling in new values.
Samsung Electro-Mechanics will take your precious feedback to grow sustainably and develop as a leading global company. I kindly ask for your
continuous love for and keen interest in Samsung Electro-Mechanics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,Samsung Engineering,1,Korea,"Samsung Engineering is a plant engineering company that has accumulated
extensive capabilities and experience from domestic and overseas
projects during its history of over 40 years. Our competence in hydrocarbon
plant, power plant, and industrial infrastructure project is widely recognized
by our clients around the world. We are committed to leading changes and
enhancing values for humankind through our efficient knowledge management
system, innovation activities, and investment in human resources
and technology.
The changing global market environment and the increased interest in our
company from stakeholders pose numerous new challenges as well as opportunities
for Samsung Engineering. We are striving to respond to these
challenges by fulfilling our responsibility as a global player and maximizing
value for our clients and shareholders. At the same time, we will preemptively
address issues arising in diverse business environments through
shared growth with the local communities, deep respect for common values
as a corporate citizen, and close cooperation with suppliersInnovating and Growing as a Global Top-tier Company
In 2012, despite the unfavorable external economic environment, we
realized sound growth and produced numerous significant records. We
penetrated the Kazakhstani, Bolivian, and Angolan markets, making power
plant field one of our main pillars of growth. Sales surpassed KRW 10 trillion
for the first time since the foundation of the company. We laid the groundwork
for entering the offshore industry, identified as a future core business.
We established a joint venture in partnership with a multinational offshore
plant engineering company and recruited outstanding human resources.
Samsung Engineering will continue efforts to make inroads into new markets
and diversify the business portfolio in 2013. At the same time, we will
focus our resources on securing quality orders, improving profitability, and
enhancing productivity to grow sustainably on a long-term basis.
Ensuring Transparent and Clean Management
To manage ethics and compliance systematically, Samsung Engineering is
conducting a compliance program which is a permanent and integrated
legal risk management system. Moreover, we have put in place a Chief
Compliance Officer and Compliance Control Standards. We also encourage
fair business practices by ramping up training on ethics and compliance.
Going forward, the company will continue to ensure compliance and fair
trade by building a clean organizational culture and raising awareness of
ethics throughout the company.
Generating Shared Value for People and the Environment
When it comes to the engineering industry, the leading sources of competitiveness
are individual skills, efficient systems and an organizational
strength that binds them. This is why Samsung Engineering emphasizes
organizational transparency through a fair, performance-based personnel
evaluation and remuneration system. We are also providing systematic
training programs, encouraging self-motivated learning, and promoting
a creative organizational culture. Since we highly value employees' safety
during the operation of our business, we continue to strengthen the safety
team and revise company guidelines following international standards.
We remain committed to helping address global environmental issues
such as climate change, biodiversity, and water scarcity as well as raising
awareness on the environment of our future generation. Our leadership in
environmental management will be enhanced by continuously focusing
on energy-reducing engineering, eco-friendly procurement, and through
environmental control at all construction sites.
Growing in Tandem with Society
As companies grow, their influence on society and environment increases,
which calls for greater corporate social responsibilities. Samsung Engineering
is constantly searching for ways to meet the expectations of stakeholders
in regions where we operate and to grow together with them. We are
contributing to the development of the local economy by cooperating
with local companies, hiring local employees, and providing vocational
training to the people. Other activities reflecting the characteristics of our
business include improving infrastructures in developing neighborhoods,
building libraries to help people learn in countries where we do business,
offering classes on the environment to children, and inviting international
environmental events.
Samsung Engineering is committed to improving the transparency of its
operations and enhancing value for its stakeholders through unceasing
innovation. We are ready to listen to our stakeholders. I ask for your continuous
support and interest.
Sincerely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,Samsung Engineering,3,Korea," I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your unwavering support and encouragement of
Samsung Engineering.
In 2014, the plant construction industry experienced a diffi cult year amid a fl uctuating business environment
resulting from of a slowing global economy and falling oil prices. Despite these challenges,
however, Samsung Engineering managed to achieve meaningful results, landing new projects in Kuwait,
Iraq, Algeria, and Chile. In fact, we also advanced into the high-value added LNG liquefaction plant market
with our Texas LNG Project in the U.S. Furthermore, we were able to turn a moderate profi t in 2014
that came about from our intensive project review and profi t & loss management efforts.
Over the past year, everyone at Samsung Engineering has devoted themselves to laying the groundwork
for an economic rebound and putting the business fully back on track. To begin, we carried out an
overhaul of the project risk management system to bolster our capabilities for the effective prevention
and management of risks. Inter-functional seamless collaboration and cost effi ciency initiatives also
helped us increase our fundamental cost competitiveness. For the coming year, our primary goal is to
strengthen our business fundamentals so that we can attain our goals through comprehensive schedule
management and process innovation. While we continue enhancing our profi tability with detailed
marketing strategies, we will make inroads into high value-added markets such as LNG liquefaction and
North American markets.
In addition, Samsung Engineering was active in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR), maintaining
diverse channels with its stakeholders on all its CSR activities. Always of key concern, safety remained
at the top of our priority list in our organizational and management systems. We also continued
campaigns with employees and suppliers to establish a safety-fi rst corporate culture. Under the belief
that diversity throughout the workforce constitutes our unrivaled competitiveness, we will continue to
promote opportunities for developing global leaders and competencies. At the same time, we will do our
utmost to further our environmental management capabilities in all our business activities, and continue
to develop projects that lend our business acumen to numerous CSR activities. Finally, we will continue
to communicate with various stakeholders in communities where we operate to generate shared value
for all.
Looking ahead, the global economy does not appear to have a bright outlook for 2015. Moderate recovery
in the U.S. economy does not seem to be backed up by growth in Europe or Japan, while emerging
markets are still mired in uncertainties and market instability. Added to this will be continuously falling
oil prices, which will almost certainly lead to delays in order placements for several projects and to
contractions in how much is actually invested, and yet all the while competition is only growing within
the industry. Fortunately, after refl ecting back on the past year¡¯s performance and mistakes, Samsung
Engineering is now ready to make 2015 a banner year for all its stakeholders. As we stride towards
a brighter future and regain market confi dence through practical actions, we remain steadfast in our
belief that our business thrives when the community we operate in also thrives. As such, everybody at
Samsung Engineering will listen carefully to the voices of stakeholders, and do their utmost to further
our corporate value.
At this time I would like to humbly ask for your continued support and encouragement of our efforts to
bring about a more sustainable society for all.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
559,Samsung Engineering,4,Korea,"I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your unwavering support and
encouragement towards Samsung Engineering.
In 2015, Samsung Engineering experienced a difficult year due to a lasting low oil price
and recession of the global economy. Despite these challenges, Samsung Engineering
managed to achieve meaningful results. We re-entered the North American market, the
world¡¯s largest plant market, and won new projects in the areas of EO/EG (Ethylene Oxide,
Ethylene Glycol) and refinery to lay the foundation for a stable growth. Furthermore,
based on our project execution capability, we won the MEED Quality Award for Projects
for four consecutive years, which is one of the most prestigious awards in the Middle East.
Samsung Engineering has continued to communicate with society through its unique
programs such as environmental education for future generations through Eco-generation,
establishment of Hope Libraries and development of wells for the Water of Life Program,
and outreach activities in local communities. In addition, we have put our utmost efforts for
sustainability in all our ongoing projects by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and wastes
and using water resources systematically and according to plans. All of these achievements
could not have been possible if it were not for your support. I would like to express my
sincere gratitude.
However, there is no end in sight to the present recession of the global economy. Against
this backdrop, we will focus on improving our business fundamentals for a long-term
growth and leap forward under the slogan of ¡°Reset 2016.¡± We will strengthen our
competitive edge in the areas where we outcompete other global players in order to build
a foundation for a stable growth. We are already producing visible results in our four major
products, which are EO/EG, ethylene, fertilizer and GSP/GOSP (Gas Separation Plant, Gas
Oil Separation Plant). Furthermore, we will continue to look for areas where we will devote
our energy and resources for a long-term development. We will thoroughly prepare and
verify our four major engines of growth, which are the North American market, brownfield
projects, LNG, and bio projects, to minimize risks. And we have already established a system
to support this. An optimized ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system befitting our
business model has been established to firmly set root a management based on data.
With this system, we will conduct integrated management of our experience assets,
capabilities and risks to create the most optimal environment for project execution.
Samsung Engineering will keep paying attention to global environmental issues including
climate change, biodiversity, and water shortage, and strive to enhance our environmental
management capabilities in all business areas through eco-friendly and energy-reducing
designs, green purchasing, and reduction of wastes. Also, we will continue to fulfill our
responsibility as a global corporate citizen through social contribution to local communities
in Korea and overseas.
Samsung Engineering will continue to communicate with various stakeholders through
transparent and ethical management. I would like to kindly ask for your continued support
and encouragement.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,Samsung Fire &Marine Insurance,1,Korea," I would like to begin by expressing sincere gratitude to all of our
stakeholders who have contributed to the success of Samsung Fire
and Marine Insurance (SFMI) to date.
In 2012, SFMI has recorded strong sales and steady profit despite
challenging management conditions such as slow growth, low
interest rates, and record-breaking weather conditions. In the past
year, we received best domestic CS evaluation and our credit
rating was upgraded to the highest Korea. 2012 was also marked
by new business growth in the overseas market with the establishment

responsibilities required by our stakeholders. In order to do so, we will push forward the following assignments:
First, we will engage in sustainable management by focusing our overall business activities on maximizing value of our stakeholders.
Our managerial operations from product development and marketing, customer service and organizational culture will be based on economical,
social and environmental perspective.
Second, SFMI will commit to becoming a respected and trusted company through management based on
principle of sharing and co-prosperity.
We will make efforts to become a company that is truly loved by stakeholders by observing law and order, and increasing social contribution
through strengthened activities of sharing and co-prosperity.
For this, we will establish a co-prosperity partnership based on trust with various cooperative agencies such as auto repair shops, car rental
services and medical organization. We will also contribute to the society by helping neglected neighbors through ¡®sharing action¡¯.
Third, we will expand our business in the global market based on our successful experience in the domestic market.

152,Samsung Fire &Marine Insurance,2,Korea,"
I am pleased to introduce SFMI's 4th sustainability report. Through the release of 2014 Sustainability Report, we wish to share with our stakeholders a comprehensive look at the efforts and actions SFMI has taken to meet the environmental, social and economic responsibility commitments. This report reflects on the progress that we have made over the years as well as on ways to improve our sustainability performance in the future.

The world economic and corporate paradigm is rapidly shifting as the aftermath of the global financial crisis. In this time of drastic changes, sustainable growth is becoming increasingly more integral to our business. This is why our stakeholder's trust and collaboration are the key drivers for our long term growth.

SEMI focuses our entire business efforts towards pursuing continual trust and love from the society and ensuring sustainable future growth. We plan to achieve such growth by increasing the value of our customers, shareholders and the society based on our slogan ""Quality growth, Working together to shape the future"".

Under our philosophy ""Working with Ownership"", our employees and risk consultants continue to prioritize the needs and opinions of our customers to establish a customer focused management. As part of our ongoing commitment to corporate responsibility, SFMI is dedicated to philanthropic engagement that embeds the characteristic of insurance business. Major socially responsible involvements include traffic safety programs, everyday life safety campaigns and support for persons with disabilities. Also, as a responsible employer to a committed workforce, SFMI strives to offer the kind of workplace that assures the happiness and development of our employees. We aim to offer career and development opportunities that will foster our employees and risk consultants into financial experts while providing them with various compensation systems. Furthermore, as part of our ongoing focus on reducing environmental risks, the company offers various eco-friendly insurance products and services and continues to improve the efficiency of our operations in order to minimize our impact on the environment.

As the result of the many commitments and actions we have achieved over the years, SFMI became the first non-life insurer to be ranked number one by NCSI (National Customer Satisfaction Index) in customer satisfaction evaluation, for 13th consecutive year. We were also the first in the auto insurance sector to be ranked number one for 16 th consecutive year and in the long-term insurance sector, for 3rd consecutive year by KCSI (Korean Customer Satisfaction Index). Additionally, SFMI was included in FTSE4Good (a social responsibility management index by the Financial Times Stock Exchange), DJSI Asia Pacific (a Dow Jones sustainability management index), and recognized as an industrial leader of carbon management by the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project).

Despite a challenging business environment in 2014, SFMI's direct premium written increased by 4.0% to KRW 12.9 trillion and net profit recorded at KRW 505.2 billion. Driven by strong operation performance, SFMI'S RBC (Risk Based Capital) ratio, a measure for financial health of an insurance company, stood at 373%, the highest in the industry. The impressive financial results reflect the virtuous circle of growth resulting from our commitment to sustainable management.

153,Samsung Fire &Marine Insurance,3,Korea,"First of all, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your kind interest and cordial support rendered
to us during the years to date. This Sustainability Report includes trustworthy information regarding
our general business status in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative G4 Guideline. It has been five years
since we first published our Sustainability Report, and through this fifth Sustainability Report, I am delighted
to share with you our company¡¯s updates on overall business status during last year.
Looking back on 2014, Korean economy underwent uneasy situation due to economic slowdown in developed
countries, with the exception of the US market, on top of the increasing economic uncertainties stemming
from emerging markets such as China and Russia. Despite these hardships, SFMI achieved net profit of
KRW 838.2 billion based on our management principle of ¡®profitable growth¡¯ that we believe is to enhance
overall corporate value and hence beneficial to our stakeholders as well. Also, we consistently maintained
our RBC (Risk-based Capital) ratio, a key measure for financial stability of insurance companies,
up to 375% - the highest level in the industry.
Reflecting sound evaluation from investors and financial communities, our share price marked its highest
record, and A.M. Best Company, a world-renowned credit rating agency for insurance companies, rated
our company the highest rating, A++, for four consecutive years. At the same time SFMI has become a valued
member of the leading sustainability indices across the globe such as DJSI World and FTSE4Good of
the London Stock Exchange.
In 2015, we will devote us to lay a solid foundation to jump up to be a global insurance company,
based on the management philosophy of ¡°Change; Innovation; and Implementation.¡±
In order for us to reach this goal, our immediate next steps are as follows:
First, we will further strengthen our customer-oriented business and expand our customer base.
Second, we will continue our efforts toward efficient work processes and consolidate the company¡¯s profitability.
Third, we will explore future growth opportunities in Korean health insurance market, and gradually expand
into overseas markets as a way of securing our new future growth engines.
I look forward to your continued interest in our company and in our journey to leap forward as a global insurance

560,Samsung Fire &Marine Insurance,4,Korea," Dear customers, shareholders, employees, partners and community citizens,
First of all, I would like to extend my hearty thanks for your continuous attention and supports to us to date.
Since 2010, SFMI has been sincerely preparing and submitting Sustainability Report in accordance with
global sustainability reporting guidelines. And, I am very delighted to share its general sustainability activities
with you by this 6th Sustainability Report.
Looking back on 2015, it was a year when global macroeconomic uncertainties loomed large from US¡¯s
interest rate change, China¡¯s economic downturn and drop of global raw material prices, posing a challenge
to domestic businesses on their way to recovery. Our profit-centered sound management, as a silver-lining in
such a cloudy environment, brought us significant growth such as achieving net profit of KRW 813.8 billion and
maintaining RBC ratio - financial soundness of an insurer - at the industry¡¯s highest level of 350%.
As a result of these efforts, we marked the highest share price level and also sustained the highest level of
customer satisfaction like winning three big customer service prizes. Besides, we maintain the highest rating
from A.M. Best ? worldwide credit rating agency for insurance companies ? for five consecutive years, while
we received ¡®AA-¡¯ one notch up from ¡®A+¡¯ from S&P, which is the highest grade among the country¡¯s private
businesses. Along the way, we sustain S&P Dow Jones Sustainability World Index the world¡¯s leading social
responsibility investment index for two consecutive years, and we were honored to be selected as the best
company in the country¡¯s non-life insurance sector.
In 2016, we at SFMI are committed to ongoing sustainability activities under the banner of ¡°Clear distinction
through sound management¡± and will lay foundation for us to jump one step forward as a leading global
insurance company.
For this, we are committed to followings.
First, we will continue our march of customer- and market-oriented management.
To brace for an aging society, we will launch products meeting customer¡¯s needs and expand customer bases.
In an effort to improve customer convenience ever more, we will further strengthen currently industry¡¯s best
internet auto insurance service and expand long-term insurance and general insurance products.
Second, we will practice ethical management and spearhead sustainability activity
in the insurance industry at home and abroad.
Currently, we are emphasizing strict ethics and respect for principles not only among whole employees also to
sister and partner companies, and we are reinforcing preventive measures such as compliance education and
check to achieve sound management and protect customer information. Moreover, we are the first Korean
insurer to become a signatory of the PSI(Principles for Sustainable Insurance) - an international treaty to
encourage sustainability management among insurance companies - and have already declared to abide by
international principles internally and externally.
Third, we will disclose our sustainability activity transparently and continue to
communicate with stakeholders sincerely.
Since 2015, we have been announcing publicly ¡®Annual report of model criteria for corporate governance¡¯
containing its principle, policy and current state. In the future, we will also manage sustainability issues
systematically and disclose related management information transparently so as to consolidate trust and
cooperation from customers and investors. We believe this is the way we can honorably return your continued
support and trust on us to you.
In our challenge to jump forward as a leading global insurance company, we look forward to your warm
attention and support as ever.
Thank you very much",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
154,Samsung Heavy Industries,2,Korea,"First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your interest in Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI,
the Company) and I am pleased to continue communicating with you through publication of this sustainability
report.
Despite challenges from both outside and inside of our organization, SHI has secured out foundation for a
quantum leap forward through changes and innovation led by offshore construction. For instance, SHI succeeded
in launching the world¡¯s first and also the largest floating LNG production facility and thus set a new
milestone for offshore construction. Further, SHI secured its global leadership position by entering into major
projects with an aggregate value of USD 13.3 billion, which include designing and constructing the world¡¯s
largest FPSO worth USD 3 billion and establishing a foothold in the large-sized jack-up rig market. In parallel,
SHI continued its efforts for sustainable development by strengthening its competitive edge both internally and
externally, interacting with stakeholders including shareholders, customers and members of local communities.
In order to enhance the happiness index of the employees, the Company is actively conducting the company-
wide Gamsananoom campaign (campaigns to encourage employees to express gratitude among one
another) and family members of employees are following suit by taking initiatives in sharing their happiness
with partner companies and local communities. SHI also continues improving its customers¡¯ satisfaction level
by conducting VOC (voice of customer) on a regular basis and improving quality indicators including the rate of
request from inspection. In addition, based on the Four Major Guidelines for Partner Companies, the Company
established a system for fair business practices and win-win growth with partner companies and fortified
volunteering activities and local community members through Heemangnuri projects. Also, SHI is taking its
lead in creating a safe and eco-friendly work environment in its shipyards by actively carrying out Green Time,
which limits motorbikes and passenger vehicles during work hours in Geoje Shipyard and establishing a
¡°3-Free Workplace¡± ? free of steel powder, cigarette butts and cables.
To make a bigger leap forward, SHI pledges to monitor shifts in relevant trends and to ensure swiftness in
making changes. Furthermore, SHI will strive to become a company that seeks sustainable growth with stakeholders
while aspiring balance between environmental protection and social development, as well as achieving
business growth. I would like to have your continued interest and support for SHI in the future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
155,Samsung Heavy Industries,3,Korea,"To our valuable stakeholders,
I extend my deepest appreciation for your continuous interest in and support for SHI.
The year 2014 proved a challenging time for SHI with the slowing global economy and a sharp drop in oil
prices. In the face of such an adverse business environment, SHI did not rest in its commitment to rising as a
global leader in the shipbuilding and offshore industry, thus achieving meaningful accomplishments in a variety
of areas. The company succeeded in co-developing the LNG-FSRU re-gasification vaporizer in cooperation
with a domestic equipment manufacturer in July of last year. This localization accomplishment will wean
SHI off foreign re-gasification vaporizers, resulting in production costs going down by 20 to 30 percent, laying
the groundwork for the Company to enhance its competitive edge. Also, in recognition of an excellent
system that puts safety atop the priority list of all work processes, SHI was awarded ¡®Grade A¡¯ in the Shipyard
Risk Assessments by the Joint Hull Committee (JHC) for two years in a row, earning the honor of the world¡¯s
safest shipyard.
Samsung Heavy Industries is committed to communicating with its employees, business partners, local communities
and other stakeholders, reflecting their ideas in management activities. For example, SHI operates
the ¡®SORISAEM¡¯, a system where employees are encouraged to post suggestions and grievances, along with a
wide array of programs and welfare benefits aimed at improving quality of life for employees. Furthermore,
the company strives to grow together with business partners through a wealth of support funds and education
programs. SHI has launched the ¡®Gratitude Sharing¡¯ campaign as part of its social responsibility activities
to help promote the development of local communities and to give a helping hand to the socially marginalized.
Also, in its initiative to respond to Climate Change, SHI channels its resources into developing
eco-friendly technology while conducting a Green Drive campaign as well as energy-saving activities, all of
which are in pursuit of realizing sustainability management.
The timeline of SHI¡¯s progress is dotted with countless challenges and adversities. SHI will draw upon the
strength it has built as it continues the journey towards emerging as the world¡¯s leading company in the
shipbuilding and offshore industry while taking preemptive actions amid the fast changing business environment.
Lastly, the company pledges to stay open to the valued feedbacks from shareholders and stakeholders
and to grow into an eco-friendly and sustainable company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
561,Samsung Heavy Industries,4,Korea," Samsung Heavy Industries (hereinafter referred to as SHI), which has successfully executed various
projects in shipbuilding and offshore fields since its foundation in 1974, consistently endeavors
to reflect the voices of its stakeholders, including clients, subcontractors, employees, and local
communities. Moreover, as a global industry leader, SHI is investing much effort in building
reliable and eco-friendly ships and offshore production facilities.
2015 has been by far the most difficult business year for SHI due to significant challenges, such as
the global economic recession, low oil prices, and a series of trials & errors in executing offshore
projects. Despite such difficult conditions, however, SHI employees endeavored to maintain safety
and quality as well as comply with delivery schedule by showing concerted commitment and
dedication, thereby transforming the crisis into opportunities.
Not only has SHI promoted the importance of safety awareness by announcing January 19th as
the official Safety Awareness Day, but it has also received the highest level of recognition in the
Safety Assessment Evaluation, conducted by ExxonMobil, for 6 consecutive years. Moreover, SHI
significantly improved quality by enforcing its 10 Quality Rule Implementation Check on a weekly
basis for flawless delivery. In the meantime, the Production Sector has succeeded in utilizing the
Dual Lifting Method, which enables a 8,000 tons and a 3,600 tons floating cranes to lift and load a
11,600 tons terra block, thereby enhancing the overall production efficiency.
SHI acutely realizes that the company¡¯s survival depends on the commitment of its employees and
is firmly determined to overcome the current crisis. The company plans to set this experience as
a valuable stepping stone for greater progress in the future. Waiting for the optimal time to arrive,
SHI will not only stay committed to basics, but also try to attain fundamental competitiveness
required to effectively respond to any harsh external environment. In closing, SHI sincerely asks
for the unwavering support and trust of its stakeholders.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,Samsung Life Insurance,1,Korea,"I am pleased to report on Samsung Life¡¯s creative changes and innovation efforts as we continue to overcome substantial
obstacles on our way to emerging as more than just Korea¡¯s top insurer, but one of the world¡¯s most respected global companies.
Over the past half century, Samsung Life has honored its promise to firmly secure the happiness of individuals, their families
and society as a whole. We have also sustained tremendous growth while solidifying our foundation as a company with
deep, long-lasting roots. In 2012, we strategically addressed rapidly changing business environments with a clear notion
of our business concept and our 2020 Long-Term Vision. At the same time, we strengthened all of our customer-oriented,
down-to-earth management practices. In addition, we proactively engaged in initiatives to give back to society and green
management practices as we faithfully carried out our business philosophy, which entails caring greatly for everyone.
In 2013, Samsung Life is embracing change and innovation as we overcome every challenge on our way to become a highly
respected global company. The path on which we find ourselves to accomplish this requires the support and collaboration
of all our stakeholders. To that effect, we have set the following four goals to maintain the trust and support of our stakeholders.
Increasing creative changes and innovation in meeting challenges
We clearly understand that any company which is content with its past success will eventually be left behind. In 2013, the
business environment is particularly formidable for everyone, especially for the insurance business, which faces great challenges
in maintaining sustainable growth due to the global economic slowdown and the Korean government¡¯s ultra-low interest
rate policy. To preemptively address these issues, Samsung Life has established an innovative process of brainstorming
and implementing new ideas to embrace creative changes and innovation. At Samsung Life, we define our business
concept as one that supports our customers to care for their loved ones in our effort to ensure financial security for a better
society. Applying this concept to the entire value chain, from creation and selling of insurance products to policy administration
and claims payments, we are committed to delivering the highest value in the insurance business. At the same time,
we are beginning a new innovation drive in 2013, working on a future-oriented work process system, and an Enterprise Resources
Planning (ERP) system to incorporate a more innovative work process into the organization. We will also continue to
operate Speed Management and Synergy Management systems for greater efficiency in the decision-making process and
subsequent implementation.Remaining a CUSTOMER-oriented company
Samsung Life is well aware that customers represent the foundation of all companies, and just as with any other company,
our own customers are always keeping a close eye on our every move. Thus, customer value is at the center of everything
we do, from providing differentiated products and services to marketing activities. While developing products that best serve
the needs of our customers and symbolize our commitment to bettering society, we are establishing a customer-oriented
process that spans everything from policy underwriting to claims payments. For instance, we have raised the rate of claims
payments on the same date they are filed by customers from 20 percent to 52 percent. By the end of 2013, we plan to raise
this figure to 80 percent. In recognition of such customer-oriented business practices the National Customer Satisfaction
Index (NCSI) ranked Samsung Life the top Korean insurer for the ninth straight year in 2012. With the unwavering belief that
customer-oriented management practices will eventually benefit the company in the long run, we will continue to further
strengthen our customer-oriented management practices.
Promoting respect for people within the organization
Samsung Life firmly believes that people constitute a company¡¯s real competitiveness, which is why we feel that our employees
are Samsung Life¡¯s most valuable asset. As a result, we are constantly offering the brightest men and women from
all fields with high-level education programs to foster them as next-generation leaders. Furthermore, we are promoting a
more communicative corporate culture throughout the company, one which puts a premium on respecting others, while
maintaining highly productive workplaces where employees enjoy coming to work every day with a sense of pride in their
company. Open and honest communication will ensure that everybody at Samsung Life carries out the company¡¯s business
concept precisely and just as it was meant to be fulfilled.
Strengthening green management and a culture of sharing in management practices
Samsung Life greatly values the importance of trust-based relationships within society. That is just part of the reason why
we practice green management and never forget to give back to society, as we are consistently building higher levels of
trust with society at large. While communicating and contributing to society, we aim to become a company that is not only
admired by customers and the nation as a whole, but one which assists in the development of society and, ultimately, the
country. An example of this commitment is Samsung Life¡¯s Sesalmaul program¡ªa community-based movement and research
center for infants, toddlers and families¡ªwhich addresses social issues related to Korea¡¯s low birth rate. Another example
is the Serotonin Drum Club program, which helps adolescents grow up to become hardworking adults who contribute to
society. More recently, we launched Samsung Life¡¯s Bridge of Life project to reduce the nation¡¯s suicide rate and took part
in a Purple Ribbon campaign to fight women¡¯s cancers. As a responsible member of the global community, we also supply
rehabilitation devices to the disabled and provide numerous educational materials through our overseas operations in China,
Thailand and Vietnam. To protect the environment and raise corporate value, we also have in place various green management
practices. While internalizing green management practices into the day-to-day lives of our employees, both at work
and at home, we also contribute to building a green society through our green finance products and services.
As a result of our indefatigable efforts to become a highly respected global company, we were the first Korean insurer to be
listed on the DJSI World index in 2012. This confirms our status as one of the world¡¯s top 14?and one of Asia¡¯s top 3?insurers
when it comes to sustainability management. Although we take pride in this achievement, we will not stop working
hard as we continue to strengthen our foundation for sustainable growth.
Every employee and consultant at Samsung Life puts customers, society and the country before anything else in all of our
business activities as we understand that the company can only prosper when our customers and society are prosperous as
a whole.
As a responsible corporate citizen, we take pride in giving back to society and creating new social values that can benefit
others.
I hope that of our stakeholders will accept my sincere gratitude when I thank them and ask for their continued support of
Samsung Life as we move forward.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,Samsung Life Insurance,3,Korea,"¡°Nurturing People with Greater Love to Build Better Financial Security¡± This is the commitment we make for our CUSTOMERS by providing our insurance plans. Dear stakeholders, I am pleased to report on the sustainability management of Samsung Life¡¯s activities as we strive to become one of the world¡¯s most respected global companies. Over the past half century, based on our strong sense of duty to provide insurance for our customers, Samsung Life has emerged as Korea¡¯s top insurer. However, as the past success does not equal future success, it is not easy for a company to sustain growth for more than 100 years. The continued economic downturn and low interest rates in 2014 sent warning signals to the financial sector, which intensified the competition for survival. Therefore, Samsung Life has strived to increase sales and strengthen profits, by setting clear goals under its goal of ¡®achieving qualitative growth through CUSTOMER oriented practices¡¯. As a result, Samsung Life made outstanding achievements that reinforced its position in protection-type products and improved new business margin, while also increased profits in spite of low interest rates. In order to respond proactively to paradigm changes in the insurance industry, such as low interest rates, low growth and aging population, to achieve qualitative growth, we have systematically reformed our platforms for management, including organizations, systems and work processes. Due to these efforts, Samsung Life became the first Korean insurer to be named on the world¡¯s most renowned sustainability list, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World, for three consecutive years. Although we take pride in these achievements, we will not stay content as we aim to become a highly respected global company by continuously undergoing innovations to meet challenges and achieve qualitative growth by maximizing corporate values. To achieve this, we will implement three core tasks this year as follows: Accelerating CUSTOMER and market-oriented qualitative growth Samsung Life will further accelerate the qualitative growth to respond to future challenges with innovations. In order to overcome the current difficult conditions and accelerate qualitative growth, we will transform all of our strategies and work processes to be CUSTOMER and market-oriented ones. Also, we will improve the competitiveness of our sales channel by innovating the development system for our FCs, while also developing unique competitiveness with differentiated business model in high growth markets, such as retirees and the affluent, and bring the globalization of asset management. Maximizing the corporate value through profits Samsung Life will further reinforce its profit and improved corporate values. In 2014, we will increase the sales of protectiontype products and improve new business values of other products, while also strengthen our profit base through continuous improvement of cost competitiveness. In addition, we will ensure prompt payment of premiums and prevent any unfair practices like insurance accidents, to protect the rights of our customers and shareholders and promote sound insurance business practices. Establishing field-oriented and performanceoriented corporate culture Samsung Life firmly believes that strategies should be implemented on site with our customers, while it is the most important means of making performances by focusing on meeting our goals. We will strive to further increase our performances, including reinforcing management practices to improve the competitiveness and execution in the field and establish performance-oriented corporate culture by getting rid of inefficient practices. Dear stakeholders, Along with the uncertainty of financial markets at home and abroad, the continuity of low interest rates and slow growth in the insurance market further weakened the market with prolonged period of low interest rates and low growth, which will bring intensified competition with other business areas due to financial convergence and the development of IT technologies. However, all of the employees at Samsung Life consider these situations is an opportunity and strive to become a highly respected global insurer as Korea¡¯s no.1 insurer. As a responsible corporate citizen, we will faithfully fulfill our role by giving back to our customers and the society. I hope that our stakeholders will continue to show their full support for Samsung Life in the future as we aim to become a highly respected insurer with high values for sustainable growth. Once again, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all of the stakeholders who have supported Samsung Life. Thank you.

562,Samsung Life Insurance,4,Korea,"I am pleased to report on the sustainability management of
Samsung Life¡¯s activities as we strive to become one of the
world¡¯s most respected global companies.
Uncertainty continued to dominate the global economy throughout
2015. The contributing factors included substantially growing risks
in China and economic crises in some major emerging economies.
Korea was no exception. Its growth potential weakened in 2015
due to low economic growth and interest rates coupled with rapid
population aging and a continuing slowdown in consumption.
The financial services sector had a difficult year. The onset of
the lowest interest rates in the country's history threatened the
financial stability of the industry. Against all odds, Samsung Life
made significant progress in 2015. It further consolidated its
market dominance in the field of protection insurance. It managed
to mitigate losses from low interest rates. Those are the results
of the company's best efforts to pursue quality growth through
expansion of its protection insurance sales and make its financial
structure as robust as possible under the vision of ¡®maximizing
corporate value.¡¯ Moreover, Samsung Life made considerable
progress in 2015 with its thorough preparations for innovations
in its management platform and the company's all out efforts to
achieve quality growth, in an effort to proactively cope with the
paradigm shift being made in the Korean insurance industry due
to the country's sustained period of low economic growth, low
interest rates and rapidly-aging society.
Due to these efforts, Samsung Life became the first Korean
insurer to be named on the world¡¯s most renowned sustainability
index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices(DJSI) World, for four
consecutive years. Samsung Life will not become complacent
with its performance in 2015. It will do its utmost in 2016 to
further accelerate its drive for ¡®value-centric management¡¯ that the
company has promoted during the past two years on the basis
of its customer-oriented business management, which advocates
placing utmost priority on customers as its backbone and starting
all over again from their perspectives. Through its ¡®quality growth¡¯,
Samsung Life desires to maximize customer values and achieve
quality growth at the same time.
All of us at Samsung Life are deeply aware of the reality that
businesses must continue to be chosen by customers in order
to survive and thrive. In 2016, the company will further evolve
its drive for customer-centric business management and quality
growth. In an effort to expand its base for continuous growth
in the future, Samsung Life will make significant progress in its
efforts to increase its market dominance in the areas of wealth,
pension and asset management.
Stabilization of Quality and Value-Centric Management
In 2016, Samsung Life will stabilize its value-centric management
and create performance results based on its outstanding quality of
management. Samsung Life will continue to make its best efforts
to produce robust performance results in 2016. To do that, it will
promote ¡®Quality growth in 3 Major Areas¡¯ including balanced
product sales, expansion of robust sales organizations, and the
enhancement of fundamentals. On the basis of the positive results
of ¡°quality growth¡±, Samsung Life will realize a virtuous cycle
of profit-making and corporate growth throughout its business
activities in 2016.
Accelerating the Implementation of Management
Innovation Activities
In the area of insurance sales, Samsung Life will stabilize its
long-term consultant education programs. Also, we will make
considerable improvements in the expansion of differentiated
agency models according to the characters of consultants,
therefore developing a more efficient sales channel. In the field
of loss assessment and claim payments, Samsung Life will place
top priority on the protection of its customers' values through
the simplification of the payment process and the prevention
of insurance fraud to stabilize a healthy insurance culture in the
country. Through the company-wide implementation of enterprise
resource planning(ERP), Samsung Life will make innovations in its
overall work procedures and methods to be on par with the worldclass
business management structure and organization adopted
by global peers in the industry. In the fields of asset management
and overseas business, Samsung Life will accelerate its thorough
preparations while boosting its power of implementation with the
view to expanding its growth potential in the future.
Establishing Field-oriented and Dynamic Corporate Culture
We are well aware that our competitiveness originates from
the outstanding performance at our operating sites where our
employees come into direct contact with our customers. The
management of Samsung Life will do everything they can to
support staff working in the company's field offices by looking at
everything from their perspective so that Samsung Life personnel
on the frontlines can fulfill their potential and concentrate their
resources on their performance more intently. In an effort to
cultivate a dynamic organizational culture company-wide,
Samsung Life will foster a work culture where members are
able to excel solely based on their work and performance; a
healthy culture where members compete and become evaluated
fairly; and a sales culture where the spirit of infinite challenge is
treasured.
Dear Stakeholders,
The domestic and global business environment is anticipated
to face further difficulties in 2016 as well. Globally, economic
uncertainty keeps growing. Domestically, seismic changes are
predicted in the competitive landscape of the financial services
industry in connection with the convergence of financial services
and ICT solutions, coupled with the ongoing massive reforms in
the country's financial services sector.
However, all the employees of Samsung Life, including myself,
have accepted this reality as opportunities for us to make further
corporate growth. We are making earnest efforts to enhance our
fundamental, differentiated competitiveness in diverse areas in
2016. Needless to say, Samsung Life engages itself in a variety
of activities that it feels obligated to carry out for the benefit of the
community it belongs to as a responsible corporate citizen and
as a way of returning the favors it has received from its members.
I will be looking forward to your continued interest in the path
that Samsung Life takes in order to grow into ¡®a leading global
company equipped with high values¡¯ through quality growth.
Once again, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all the
stakeholders who have supported Samsung Life. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
158,Samsung SDI,1,Korea,"Stakeholders of Samsung SDI across the world,
I deeply appreciate your unwavering support for Samsung SDI.
The year 2012 witnessed numerous difficulties and challenges posed
by the global economic downturn and the subsequent recession, with
the global economy reeling from both the financial crises in the US and
Europe as well as the sluggish growth of emerging markets. Despite the
rapidly changing business environment, however, Samsung SDI perceived
the wind of change as an opportunity and responded to it in
a proactive manner, based on innovations that stayed ahead of these
changes with an indomitable spirit of challenge.
In May 2012, to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of its founding,
Samsung SDI redefined the concept of its business as ¡°an eco-friendly
and electrochemical convergence energy industry.¡± This new business
concept is in line with our vision of delivering ¡°Smart Solution for a Green
World¡± and incorporates the ever-evolving business landscape, industry
outlook, and our blueprint for the future. That is, moving away from the
traditional energy industry, we picture a whole new industry that creates
clean energy through electricity generation and accumulation and
delivers a total solution that enables the use of this energy without any
time or spatial restraints. This concept also reflects Samsung SDI¡¯s will
to lay the foundation to become a leading global energy company and
contribute to an eco-friendly way of life on Earth for mankind.
Samsung SDI realigned its business portfolio based on its new business
concept and is accelerating its efforts to become an eco-friendly energy
solution company, with the rechargeable battery-driven energy business
accounting for 59% of its 2012 revenue. We also consolidated our
position as the leader in the small-size battery market for three consecutive
years, further outpacing our competitors in terms of market share,
and laid the groundwork for creating synergies with our existing battery
businesses and independent management in the car battery market by
acquiring all of the shares of SB LiMotive. Samsung SDI¡¯s competitiveness
in the energy storage system (ESS) sector has also been enhanced as our
clientele expanded to include not only Nichicon (Japan) but also KACO
(Germany), Xtreme Power (US), and Shinhan Bank (Korea).
At the same time, we undertook various initiatives to create environmentally
and socially sustainable values. In our business, we minimized
our environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of our products and
services by introducing a system to quantify and manage the impact
that our products and plants have on the environment. We also initiated
the Global Green Partnership Project, becoming the first player in Korea¡¯s
electricity/electronics industry to forge a clean production partnership
with our overseas suppliers and enhancing our capability to comply with
environmental regulations. Furthermore, Samsung SDI accelerated its efforts
to help a law-abiding culture take root in its organization by introducing
a quantitative evaluation system for its staff¡¯s legal compliance,
while always striving to fulfill all of its roles and responsibilities as a corporate
citizen by expanding its implementation of ¡°community-based¡±
social contribution programs that are in line with its business concept.
In recognition of such sustained efforts to fulfill its social responsibility,
Samsung SDI has been selected by Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes
(DJSI) for nine consecutive years, an unprecedented feat in Korea.
We aim to maximize customer satisfaction with innovative products that
always stay one step ahead of market changes and customer needs and
to meet the trust of our shareholders and investors by creating values
that far exceed their expectations. For our suppliers, our important business
partners, we will continue to promote a mutually beneficial cooperation
as a way to enhance their competitiveness, and jointly respond
to environmental and social sustainability issues based on this partnership.
For our staff, based on our new corporate culture, Samsung SDI
will create a constructive virtuous cycle in which a more lively communication
among staff and greater focus on building individual and team
capabilities contribute to the company¡¯s sustainability. We will continue

its needs and expanding our support for the socially marginalized and
the children.
Stakeholders of Samsung SDI, I ask for your enduring support and encouragement
as we continue our journey towards a sustainable future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
563,Samsung SDI,1,Korea,"Stakeholders of Samsung SDI across the world, I deeply appreciate your unwavering support for Samsung SDI. The year 2012 witnessed numerous difficulties and challenges posed by the global economic downturn and the subsequent recession, with the global economy reeling from both the financial crises in the US and Europe as well as the sluggish growth of emerging markets. Despite the rapidly changing business environment, however, Samsung SDI perceived the wind of change as an opportunity and responded to it in a proactive manner, based on innovations that stayed ahead of these changes with an indomitable spirit of challenge. In May 2012, to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of its founding, Samsung SDI redefined the concept of its business as ¡°an eco-friendly and electrochemical convergence energy industry.¡± This new business concept is in line with our vision of delivering ¡°Smart Solution for a Green World¡± and incorporates the ever-evolving business landscape, industry outlook, and our blueprint for the future. That is, moving away from the traditional energy industry, we picture a whole new industry that creates clean energy through electricity generation and accumulation and delivers a total solution that enables the use of this energy without any time or spatial restraints. This concept also reflects Samsung SDI¡¯s will to lay the foundation to become a leading global energy company and contribute to an eco-friendly way of life on Earth for mankind. Samsung SDI realigned its business portfolio based on its new business concept and is accelerating its efforts to become an eco-friendly energy solution company, with the rechargeable battery-driven energy business accounting for 59% of its 2012 revenue. We also consolidated our position as the leader in the small-size battery market for three consecutive years, further outpacing our competitors in terms of market share, and laid the groundwork for creating synergies with our existing battery businesses and independent management in the car battery market by acquiring all of the shares of SB LiMotive. Samsung SDI¡¯s competitiveness in the energy storage system (ESS) sector has also been enhanced as our clientele expanded to include not only Nichicon (Japan) but also KACO (Germany), Xtreme Power (US), and Shinhan Bank (Korea). At the same time, we undertook various initiatives to create environmentally  and socially sustainable values. In our business, we minimized our environmental impact throughout the lifecycle of our products and services by introducing a system to quantify and manage the impact that our products and plants have on the environment. We also initiated the Global Green Partnership Project, becoming the first player in Korea¡¯s electricity/electronics industry to forge a clean production partnership with our overseas suppliers and enhancing our capability to comply with environmental regulations. Furthermore, Samsung SDI accelerated its efforts to help a law-abiding culture take root in its organization by introducing a quantitative evaluation system for its staff¡¯s legal compliance, while always striving to fulfill all of its roles and responsibilities as a corporate citizen by expanding its implementation of ¡°community-based¡± social contribution programs that are in line with its business concept. In recognition of such sustained efforts to fulfill its social responsibility, Samsung SDI has been selected by Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) for nine consecutive years, an unprecedented feat in Korea. We aim to maximize customer satisfaction with innovative products that always stay one step ahead of market changes and customer needs and to meet the trust of our shareholders and investors by creating values that far exceed their expectations. For our suppliers, our important business partners, we will continue to promote a mutually beneficial cooperation as a way to enhance their competitiveness, and jointly respond to environmental and social sustainability issues based on this partnership. For our staff, based on our new corporate culture, Samsung SDI will create a constructive virtuous cycle in which a more lively communication among staff and greater focus on building individual and team capabilities contribute to the company¡¯s sustainability. We will continue to grow with the community we belong to, paying greater attention to its needs and expanding our support for the socially marginalized and the children. Stakeholders of Samsung SDI, I ask for your enduring support and encouragement as we continue our journey towards a sustainable future.
CEO Message
President & CEO Sang Jin Park",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
159,Samsung SDI,2,Korea," Let me express my heartfelt gratitude for your continuous regard and support for
Samsung SDI.
The year 2013 was a year of strenuous endeavors to overcome the global financial
crises and recover the economy. Gaining economic vitality has never been an
easy task and the prolonged low economic growth continued. Yet, in the face of
such uncertainties in the external world, Samsung SDI rose to the challenge of
overcoming these harsh business conditions through its robust drive for overall
change and innovation .
Samsung SDI solidified its position as a global No. 1 company by further distancing
itself from other competitors in the small-sized rechargeable battery market.
With the full-fledged shipment of batteries for electric vehicles, Samsung SDI¡¯s
automotive battery operations exceeded its target in winning contracts last year
and this put its automotive battery business on the right track for solid and stable
growth. In the ESS segment, Samsung SDI¡¯s share in the Japanese residential
application market rose significantly and its technology was widely recognized as
it became the 1st in the industry to obtain quality certifications in the U.S., Japan
and Germany.
Meanwhile, as major and minor safety incidents have occurred in Korean companies
and raised alertness, Samsung SDI further reinforced its safety & environment
management system. Samsung SDI integrated safety & environment groups in its
domestic plants and upgraded their status as a team under the supervision of an
executive. It also established a safety-centered organizational culture through the
realignment of wide-ranging safety environmental standards and by reinforcing
the prevention of chemical accidents. These safety initiatives were also disseminated
to suppliers.
The shared growth programs with the suppliers have been also further developed.
Samsung SDI became the 1st in the domestic electrical and electronics
industry to forge clean production partnerships with its suppliers who possess a
global presence. Furthermore, it undertook the Global Green Partnership projects
to build stronger capabilities to respond to environmental regulations.
Samsung SDI quantifiably measured and managed the environmental impact
of its products and business sites, so as to minimize its environmental footprint
throughout the entire life cycle of its products and services. The company developed
social contribution programs that are aligned with its business operations
and engaged more employees in such social-giving and talent-donation programs.
Its sustained commitment to corporate social responsibility was publicly
recognized as Samsung SDI became the 1st Korean company to be listed on the
Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for ten straight years as of 2013.
In July 2014, Samsung SDI will take on a new challenge through the merger with
Cheil Industries, a Samsung affiliate specialized in materials. Samsung SDI redefined
its strategy to build on the synergistic effects from this merger. This merger
will allow Samsung SDI to break through its limitations as a parts and system provider
and to evolve into a truly world-class company in the materials and energy
sector.
Samsung SDI vows to always strive to achieve joint-growth with its shareholders
together. Samsung SDI will continue to build capabilities for future growth, do its
utmost to deliver the greatest-possible customer satisfaction and communicate
with the local communities to pursue mutually-beneficial partnerships.
As the company takes a new leap forward towards a sustainable future, we would
like to ask for your continued interest in and support for Samsung SDI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
160,Samsung SDI,3,Korea," First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude for your concern and support all throughout the previous year.
During the year 2014, Samsung SDI focused all efforts to establish a sustainable business structure that can grow continuously, in spite of low economic growth globally over a long period. The merger with the prev. Cheil Industries¡¯ material business unit, Samsung SDI pave the way to become the ¡®world¡¯s leading total solutions provider in materials and energy¡¯ handling a range of solutions from materials and parts to system business.
With efforts to develop next-generation technologies, Samsung SDI¡¯s small-sized Li-ion battery business was able to launch the world¡¯s first flexible battery, thereby cementing its position as the global leader. As for the medium-to-large battery business, Samsung SDI built a firm foundation to lead the market by expanding the contract with a global automobile company to supply batteries, and acquiring the battery pack business for electric vehicles from a world-class automotive supplier Magna International. The success of the electronic materials business helped the company to become Korea¡¯s first company to mass produce core material for OLED, one of the next-generation growth engines. Chemical business has focused on strengthening the competitive edge in design which helped the company win the ¡®iF Design Award¡¯ for its emotional material.
Meanwhile, Samsung SDI made various efforts to establish a safety-driven culture which is becoming more important every day. Samsung SDI reinforced safety and environment team and system, the control tower to all workplaces of businesses in and out of the country. The subject of its supervision was broadened to encompass overseas sites and stationed suppliers to strengthen the basis of safe and environment management.
Our programs to grow with our suppliers and local communities have been further developed. With technological developments and educational activities in addition to financial support, Samsung SDI strives to establish a foundation for shared growth with its first-tier suppliers as well as its second and third tier suppliers. In an effort to make a valuable world through sharing technologies and competence with local communities, Samsung SDI launched its social contribution brand ¡®wE Dream¡¯. This helps the company¡¯s business sites to closely and actively support their local communities.
In an effort to establish a fair and transparent corporate culture, Samsung SDI puts compliance management as its first business principle and carries out various activities, including customized training sessions and site inspections for its employees to develop their law-abiding spirits.
Even though it is expected that the instability of the global economy will worsen in 2015, Samsung SDI¡¯s success DNA of being the world¡¯s best in CRT & PDP and small-sized Li-ion batteries, and its successful transformation from a fabric industry to a cutting-edge material company shows the potential it possesses. While bringing out maximized synergy amongst materials and energy businesses and pursuing world-leading changes to improve the company, Samsung SDI will continue to strive to grow with shareholders, customers, suppliers, and local communities. We would like to ask for your continued interest and support for Samsung SDI as we will make every effort to fulfill your expectation. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
161,Samsung Securities,1,Korea,"In FY2012, the global economic recession and volatility in the world¡¯s financial markets persisted
amid continuous financial turmoil in Europe and slow growth in China, which have domestic
stock markets to contract. A changing investment environment, including low-interest
rates and an overall aging society, decreased the number of clients looking for high-risk/highreturn
products. Consequently, the daily market trading volume, which used to hover around
KRW 9 trillion, has fallen to around KRW 6 trillion, while equity-type fund markets lost investments
of roughly KRW 8 trillion. Meanwhile, amendments to Korea¡¯s Capital Markets Act
were delayed, so financial services companies faced hurdles when preparing to start new
businesses with raised equity capital.
Samsung Securities, however, was steadfast in responding preemptively to market changes,
despite temporary profit declines. We reorganized our business structure to a more clientoriented
approach, and reacted to the changing needs of our clients, such as retirement solutions,
tax planning, and the increased preference for medium-risk/medium-return products.
We were therefore able to post net revenue of KRW 965.6 billion and net income of KRW
157.8 billion for FY2012. Such returns were enabled by stable revenue generation as we
proactively responded to the changing needs of our clients, as well as via enhanced cost efficiency
through various innovative measures, despite reduced commissions and fees amid
a slow market. Notably, our high net-worth individual (HNWI) client base and client assets
rose y-y, further solidifying our unrivaled position in the wealth management market.Under such conditions, we continued to observe the most important values of a financial company,
like client trust and integrity management, while actively contributing to society in order
to share our good fortune. Samsung Securities was named as the top securities company in
terms of complete sales of funds for three consecutive years, mainly due to the determination
of our staff to engage in ethical management. Our 131 volunteer teams conducted social activities
nationwide to meet the needs of local communities. In 2012, we established ties with
nine farming villages ? up from four in 2011 ? and opened the ¡°Dream Maru,¡± library for children
of low-income families in an effort to share with fellow citizens from all areas of society.The securities industry faces a difficult business environment amid slowing domestic growth,
a continuing stock market slump, and rising competition. Despite of this, Samsung Securities
is committed to the basic principle of ¡°The greatest value is our clients.¡± In early 2013, we
placed plaques engraved with the pledge of our employees at the entrance to every branch
nationwide. Samsung Securities is devoted to providing the best products and services for
our clients based on the principle of client-oriented management.
First, we provide comprehensive wealth management services, develop products optimized
to the needs of clients by using our advanced CRM system, and offer timely investment
information in a rapidly changing market. We will also improve the overall process of
financial products sales from development, sourcing, operation, and management to secure
competitiveness and prompt responses to a fluctuating market environment and rapidly
evolving client needs.
In the wholesale and IB businesses, we strive to improve the organization¡¯s overall health to
enhance our long term competitiveness by promoting collaborative marketing among business
divisions and focusing on providing sophisticated solutions to meet the investment needs of
institutional clients. This will all help us to grow into a market leader in the core M&A and IPO
businesses utilizing our top talents. Amendment to the Capital Markets Act will help us diversify
revenue sources and generate synergy with existing businesses by taking full advantage
of new opportunities like corporate lending and alternative trading system (ATS). We can
therefore position ourselves as a financial services company known for creating stable results,
while maximizing client satisfaction and profits.
As the first domestic financial company to be incorporated into the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index (DJSI) for three consecutive years, Samsung Securities will set the example for
the industry¡¯s sustainability management. First, we commit ourselves to creating a sound
organizational culture where everyone benefits from equal opportunities based on ¡°open
recruitment¡± and a fair HR management system, ensuring talented individuals can trust their
company and realize their full potential. We will also continue to support children and give
them hope through our signature CSR programs, such as Financial Academy for Children
and Dream Maru. Last, as the nation¡¯s top securities firm, we will lead the green and social
investment culture with products such as the ¡°Good Fund¡± and ¡°Green Fund¡± to spread financial
products that will take care of future generations.
Dear stakeholders,
We expect that a challenging market environment will continue for the foreseeable future.
Samsung Securities has a long-term outlook, however, instead of focusing on short-term
profits, with the spirit of Seoungpung Parang, which is an idiom that means ¡°withstanding
winds and waves with a far-reaching goal in mind¡±. We will lay the basis for sustainable
growth with client trust and integrity management to showcase our full potential with constant
innovation throughout all of our departments and divisions. Again, we will share with the
entire society as a trusted partner. All of us at Samsung Securities appreciate the continued
support and encouragement from our stakeholders
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
162,Samsung Securities,2,Korea,"In 2013, we had to contend with recession amid continuing uncertainties in the world
economy such as slowing growth in China, the possibility of US tapering its quantitative
easing. The average daily trading value of South Korea¡¯s stock market fell to the KRW 5
trillion (half of its 2011 high), while the value of the domestic fund market remained stable
at 2007 pre-crisis level of KRW 330 trillion. More than a third of South Korean securities
brokers recorded losses and many were put up for sale.
Regardless of our effort to attract client assets and reduce expenses, FY 2013 net revenue
and net profit recorded KRW 557.9 billion and KRW 11.0 billion, respectively as brokerage
commission and bond sales dropped.
Despite this challenging environment, we firmly believe that corporate responsibility plays
a crucial role in our long-term success as a business and as a partner to our clients. We
therefore strive to incorporate social responsibilities into every aspect of our work and
maintain a prudent taking of risk in line with our strategic priorities.
Our social contribution activities, carried out by 123 volunteer teams across the country,
are designed to meet the needs of the communities in which we operate. We also increased
our caring and sharing projects, such as providing free retirement planning and
no-cost donation consulting services. These activities have proven to be a major means of
enhancing our leadership in the area of sustainable management. Last year, we became
the only company in the domestic financial industry to be confirmed as a member of Dow
Jones Sustainability Index World for the fourth consecutive year.
In 2014, despite a gradual recovery in the global economy, South Korea is likely to continue
experiencing low growth due to weak consumer demand and continued sluggishness
in the real estate sector.
We expect competition in the stock market to intensify as securities brokers increase their
focus on selling products on mobile platforms and trading-value growth remains low. The
introduction of fund supermarkets will also present challenges for the financial products
market, while the securities industry as a whole will likely see more alliances and mergers.We believe, however, that strongly capitalized banks with a clear and demonstrated client
focus will have a competitive advantage.
Here at Samsung Securities, client-oriented management remains our highest priority. We
will concentrate on building client trust by making dramatic innovations to our organizational
culture, business systems, and operating processes. These will include strengthening our
expertise in private banking, increasing head office assistance for clients, and enhancing
online systems and contents. These steps will help us secure a stable revenue base by
attracting new clients and increasing the value of their assets.
We will also focus on the implementation of our integrated bank strategy on increasing the
market share in wealth management and strengthening our competitiveness in future growth
drivers, such as corporate lending and prime brokerage.
In the face of stagnant markets, our integrated business model will adjust to achieve resilient
and sustainable long-term growth via continuing cost reduction and enhancing productivity
through process innovation.
We will also make efforts to provide the right developmental opportunities based on
individual and organizational needs for our employees. Besides prudent approach to
employee strategy, we firmly believe that corporate responsibility plays a crucial role in our
long-term success as a business. We therefore endeavor to incorporate our approach into
activities including ¡°Dream-maru,¡± an economy class for youth, and ¡°YAHO¡± community
service team.
Although we expect the market environment will remain uncertain in 2014, Samsung
Securities will do its utmost to maintain its position as the leading South Korean financial
player, committed to achieve strong, safe, and continuous growth that will ensure our clients¡¯
trust. Rather than to blame such a challenging environment, we will stay firm, facing the
future with a belief in the value of creativity, innovation, and confidence.
We would like to sincerely thank all our clients, shareholders, employees, and other
stakeholders at all levels for their exceptional contributions and continued support.
Yours sincerely,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
163,Samsung Securities,3,Korea,"In retrospect, Samsung Securities has fought harder than ever starting in 2014 to overcome
challenges posed by a delayed recovery of the securities business environment.
Emerging market crises, coupled with an abrupt plunge in oil prices, fanned uncertainties
and volatility last year in global financial markets. Simultaneously, the KOSPI sagged, despite
government stimuli, with its trading value staying near a low set in 2013.
Moreover, Korea¡¯s securities industry was undermined by crises affecting both the market and
sector credibility in the wake of capital flight over diminishing return on investments (ROI) and
inadequate after-sales services.
To meet these challenges, Samsung Securities addressed key client grievances to restore trustbased
relationships with clients by fundamentally changing its business practices. While
realigning its financial advice with client investment goals and providing thorough explanations
on investment specifications, we reviewed and then strengthened our procedures regarding the
monitoring of after-sales service practices.
As a result, our performance significantly improved last year over 2013, as the total value of
client assets under management (AUM) surged to KRW 136 trillion and net profit hit KRW 229.5
billion.
We also adhere to our basic principles of exhaustive risk management as we continue to fulfill
our corporate social responsibilities via social contribution programs.
Our certified information security control further bolstered client information protection practices,
and consistent efforts were made to save energy and resources as part of our commitment to
green management. As of last year, our signature CSR program, Youth Securities Academy, has
motivated over 160,000 students to acquire basic knowledge on economics.
In order to promote educational equality, we upgraded dilapidated facilities and equipment at 13
children¡¯s charities nationwide and continue to operate our afterschool program Dream Maru,
which specializes in children from low-income families.
In recognition of our consistent engagement with social and environmental issues and exemplary
sustainability management practices, Samsung Securities was included in DJSI World in 2014 for

564,Samsung Securities,4,Korea,"In the first half of 2015, quantitative easing in some advanced economies and soaring Chinese stock indexes, coupled with growing expectations of a Korean economic recovery, drove up the price of stocks in Korea. Towards the end of the year, however, investment conditions faced a new threat from emerging problems in the world¡¯s financial markets, such as US rate hikes and the slowing growth of the Chinese economy.
Even amid this challenging business environment, Samsung Securities strove towards realizing its annual business goals. As a result, its consolidated net revenue reached KRW 995.9 billion, with profits attributable to controlling interest hitting KRW 275 billion?the highest figure for the company since 2007. Meanwhile, our assets under management (AUM) expanded to reach an industry-high KRW 174 trillion, while fee-generating assets?the barometer of operational stability?also swelled to achieve significant performance in terms of setting long-term, stable business fundamentals.
At the same time, Samsung Securities appointed a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) as an independent information security employee with controlling authority in a bid to step up the company¡¯s efforts towards customer information protection and secure financial transactions in a stable risk management system.
All the while, we have remained steadfast in our social contribution initiatives. Our signature program, the Youth Economics & Securities Academy, marked its 10th anniversary in 2015, while the Samsung Securities Volunteer Corps is also active in various programs in which our volunteer group leaders select key tasks that can best serve local needs in collaboration with related governmental and non-governmental organizations. Throughout 2015, we also offered cultural and artistic programs for underprivileged youths from low-income families, multicultural families, and North Korean defectors, and even donated homemade kimchi to the needy. As a result, Samsung Securities was recognized as the Korean securities firm having made the greatest social contributions in 2015. Moreover, as part of our efforts to protect the environment, we continue practicing company-wide green-management practices while reducing our energy use.
In recognition of these exemplary sustainability management efforts, Samsung Securities in 2015 became the first Korean financial company to be listed on the DJSI World for a sixth consecutive year.
At the dawn of 2016, competition in Korea¡¯s capital markets was intensifying. The emergence of mega-sized securities firms and synergies from financial holding companies poses a threat to our operations, not only in terms of size but also with respect to quality.Despite this, everyone at Samsung Securities is doing our utmost to help complete a virtuous cycle of
business fundamentals based on client-oriented management in order to return our clients¡¯ trust with
the highest possible stakeholder value. In so doing, we aim to become the most prominent wealth
manager in Korea, while remaining respected and trusted by clients.
To that end, Samsung Securities realigned its products and channel networks in the past year to
offer optimal products and customized consulting services to mass individual clients as well as highnet-
worth clients. In particular, our global research was reinforced, facilitating our ability to respond
swiftly to client needs. We will continue expanding our research and product networking capabilities
with leading international investors to further solidify our position as a competitive wealth manager
in the global market.
Moreover, we have completed the development of computer systems and platforms that will bring
our industry-leading asset management competencies to the cyber realm through online and mobile
platforms. In addition, we are ready to take the lead in emerging FinTech markets.
While living up to our core value of integrity, we are constantly striving to generate shared social
value as we comply with business ethics on a continuing basis, solidifying our position as the leader
in sustainability management practices in Korea¡¯s financial sector. Not only does Samsung Securities¡¯
sound corporate culture allow for top industry talent to reach their full potential, but its systematic
risk-management protects client and shareholder value. At the same time, the company is faithfully
fulfilling its responsibilities and duties to society, thereby contributing to a better world of sharing and
caring for co-prosperity.
In 2016, all Samsung Securities employees are determined to strengthen the organization¡¯s efficiency
and promptness to meet our stakeholders¡¯ high expectations, while enhancing corporate value and
laying the groundwork for long-term, sustainable growth through a stable business platform firmly
based on firm-client trust.
We hope to maintain your unwavering trust and encouragement in our efforts toward achieving a
virtuous circle of client-oriented management.

164,Shinhan Financial Group,3,Korea," We experienced a rough year in 2014 for a number of social and economic
reasons. Not only did we suffer from numerous accidents and dramatic
events, but the global economy became more uncertain due to accelerating
changes in our economy¡¯s structure caused by low economic growth and
the phenomenon of an ageing society. It is widely expected that such
dismal economic trends will continue throughout this year as well.
Amid this unpromising economic scenario, the social role of corporations
is becoming increasingly important. In response, Shinhan Group set
¡®Compassionate Finance, Your Companion for the Future¡¯ as its mission
back in 2011, and has consistently striven to fulfill its social responsibilities
in the domain of finance, its main business. In particular, last year we
strengthened our ability to carry out our mission of ¡®compassionate
finance, Your Companion for the Future¡¯ by making the practical methods
and directions of our mission clearer.
The group has continued providing products and services according to the
financial needs of the customers, and has searched for diverse methods of
increasing profits from their assets. Furthermore, to fulfill the financial duties
expected by society, we have actively promoted technology finance and
small-loan finance. In addition to that, we have proactively created a business
infrastructure for retirement in preparation for an ageing Korean society.
As a result of such efforts, and despite the slowdown of the economic
recovery due to a fall in consumption and investment, the group was able
to maintain its top position within the financial sector.
In fact, our group has enriched its global status overseas, having been
selected as one of the top 100 global corporations for sustainability
management in the Davos Forum for three consecutive years, as well
as being included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for two
consecutive years.
This year, Shinhan Financial Group plans to promote the following tasks
in order to strengthen its ability to practice ¡®Compassionate Finance, Your
Companion for the Future¡¯.
First, we aim to establish and enhance our ability to practice the
organizational culture, ¡®Compassionate Finance, Your Companion for the
Future¡¯, in order to provide a differentiated customer experience. Our
policies and systems will be constantly upgraded, and we will create and
spread a culture in which all our departments and employees execute
compassionate finance.
Furthermore, we will channel more effort and resources into delivering
creative financial services by facilitating the creation of new value. Last
year, Shinhan Financial Group engaged in new endeavors which led to the
diversification of our investment methods and the improvement of our
customers¡¯ profits. However, there is still room for further improvement.
Looking ahead, the group will concentrate on developing new products
and services to enhance both Shinhan¡¯s and its customers¡¯ value.
Also, as a leading financial group, we will systematically promote
our corporate social responsibilities (CSR) in a bid to strengthen our
management¡¯s sustainability. Back in 2014, Shinhan Group established
nine CSR strategies with the purpose of creating value in the sectors of
economy, society, and environment. In 2015, the group will focus on
eight major sectors, namely, consumer protection, ethical management,
risk management, employees, local community, suppliers, environment
impacts, and eco-friendly products and services. Moreover, the group
will strengthen the support for its suppliers to help them improve their
sustainability. In order to make decisions from an ever more objective and
reasonable perspective with regard to our CSR strategies and directions,
the CSR committee will be operated under the board of directors. Finally,
we will consistently comply with and practice the global sustainability
management initiative. In 2008, Shinhan joined the UN Global Compact
and agreed to comply with the ten principles associated with human
rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, and is reviewing its
performance thereof on a regular basis. In addition, as Shinhan has
participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), it is now pursuing the
global standard in the field of environment as well. Shinhan will continue
to actively participate in global CSR initiatives to evolve into a role model
corporation that fits the global CSR standard.
Shinhan Financial Group will incessantly strive to fulfill its mission to
realize ¡®Compassionate Finance, Your Companion for the Future¡¯. I ask
for your continuous interest and enthusiasm for the new path of finance
that Shinhan Financial Group plans to open in the future.
Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
565,Shinhan Financial Group,4,Korea," Shinhan Financial Group started the first private holding company in 2001,
keeping pace with the global trends of diversification and enlargement. Later,
Shinhan Financial Group established a balanced business portfolio between
banks and non-banks and created synergy based on the strength of each
affiliate, growing as a financial group which represents Korea.
In 2015, Shinhan Financial Group took one step further towards promoting
sustainable growth. Even with the consistent decrease in profits for the overall
industry as low growth and low interest rates became the New Normal,
Shinhan Financial Group achieved a net profit of KRW 2.37 trillion. This was
thanks to the efficient management of asset integrity as well as creation of
balanced profit between banking and non-banking sectors. With this, Shinhan
Financial Group established its status as the leading business in the financial
sector.
Also, as a result of practicing Compassionate Finance, Shinhan Financial Group
ranked 18th on the list of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations at the
Davos Forum, ranking the highest among Korean firms. Shinhan Financial Group
also had the honor of being included in Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
for three consecutive years, being recognized as the first place in the banking
sector in Korea. Shinhan Financial Group was the only listed company in Korea
which acquired A+ in the ESG integrated grade, receiving the Grand Prize for
outstanding management governance from the Korea Corporate Governance
Service, confirming its high esteem in sustainability.
Domestic and foreign economic conditions are not likely to improve easily
in 2016. Unlike the United States, which increased its interest rates, various
countries such as China, European countries, and Japan are continuing
quantitative easing, which is expected to bring huge confusion to the global
finance market. Also, along with the rapid growth of ICT, Fintech companies,
including Internet Primary Banks, are entering the financial market, which is
expected to greatly change the competitive landscape.
In order to adapt to the rapidly changing environment and to achieve
sustainable growth, Shinhan Financial Group aims to trigger a new revolution
through ceaseless change and innovation. In this respect, Shinhan will carry out
the following tasks in 2016.
First, we aim to incorporate ¡®Compassionate Finance, Your Companion
for the Future¡¯ in the routine works of our employees, which will create
various cases of providing differentiated experiences to our customers. Our
customers will learn that they can obtain greater values by doing business
with Shinhan, as characterized by technology finance, expansion of the CIB
model to small and large businesses, and development of differentiated
products and services for improving customer values.
Next, we will seek new ways that can increase customer values in accordance
with changes in the digital environment. We are already facing a new period
where the digital environment leads social change. Along with such changes,
we will develop products and services that fit the digital age through creative
innovation, and will build the most convenient and safest digital finance from
the perspective of our customers.
In addition, we aim to acquire a new engine for growth in the global market,
centering on Asia, which has high potential for growth. Although Shinhan
Financial Group is solidifying its place in some Asian countries, such as
Vietnam, its presence in the entire region still remains low. We will diversify
our expansion strategies such as utilizing non-face-to-face channels and will
strengthen sales-based localization so that our global business will grow as an
axis of growth.
Lastly, we will continue to promote our corporate social responsibility(CSR)
activities. We will check the status and support our group affiliates and
suppliers¡¯ CSR activities so that they can improve the level of their CSR, in a
bid to increase the overall sustainability of the company. Shinhan Financial
Group joined UN Global Compact, promising to comply with the ten principles
related to human rights promotion, environment promotion, opposition to
labor discrimination, and anti-corruption, and will make regular examinations
on subsequent achievements. Also, we will continue to participate in global
initiatives such as the Carbon Disclosure Project(CDP), growing as an exemplary
company that takes the initiative in CSR activities.
One of the factors that enabled Shinhan Financial Group to accomplish
unprecedented growth is the ¡®Shinhan WAY¡¯, the corporate culture and value
that is exclusive to Shinhan. Shinhan Financial Group will continue to uphold
the spirit of ¡®Shinhan WAY¡¯ and will promote finance where customers,
Shinhan, and society can achieve mutual growth. We ask for your attention
and love along the way to realizing new finance, which Shinhan Financial
Group plans to pioneer.
Thank you very much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are transforming the business environment, SK chemicals managed to
produce visible achievements in a number of strategic areas in 2012,
successfully completing its restructuring, identification of sources for its
future growth, and enhancement of the competitiveness of its existing
businesses.
Throughout 2012, all the members of SK chemicals remained
unified in pursuing the common goal of sustainable growth, by pressing
for the investment in the PPS project, which is expected to lead the
Company¡¯s future, and by facilitating the successful completion of the
vaccine R&D milestones. The Company also sought to strengthen the
sustainability of its existing operations by expanding the copolyester
plant and by adding a new unit to the plant at Cheongju.
The Green Culture, Green Process, and Green Products campaign
that had sustained SK chemicals¡¯ environmental management has been
extended in scope to apply to all areas of the Company¡¯s sustainable
management efforts. Thanks to these and its other accomplishments,
SK chemicals managed to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index (DJSI) Korea for three years in a row, and also went on to win the
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Award.
The Green Culture, Green Process, and Green Products campaign
at SK chemicals seeks to enhance the sustainability of the Company,
society, and individuals, in the belief that doing so affects the happiness
of stakeholders. More specifically, the campaign seeks to help solve
the problems of environmental degradation and the growing incomeinequality that are the byproducts of the advancement of civilizations.
SK chemicals seeks to create an ecosystem of coexistence, which heals
nature and people¡¯s minds while ensuring continued benefits for civilizations.
The Company thus ensures and manages operations in ways that
minimize the burden on the natural environment, generate new values
for the future, and narrow the socioeconomic gaps among people.
The efforts SK chemicals has made, setting examples for environmental
management worldwide, include its campaigns to maximize the
energy efficiency of its operations and to minimize the environmental
burdens from its business activities. Various business sites of SK chemicals
are following the Company¡¯s Carbon Neutrality Roadmap, using
biofuels, solar energy, and geothermal generation to support their operations.
The Company also produces an increasing range and number
of eco-friendly products, including the heat-resistant plastic ECOZEN¢ç
and biodiesel. The Company building, EcoLab, earned the Platinum
rating from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).
The Company also plans to complete the construction of Korea¡¯s largest
vaccine plant in Andong, thereby enhancing the synergy in the research
and development of chemicals and biotechnology.
As part of its efforts to bridge growing socioeconomic gaps, SK
chemicals supports children around the world through its sponsorship
of Compassion, while employees continue to participate in an increasing
range of volunteer works that support children and youth financially
and otherwise. The Company also seeks to narrow the urban-rural gap
by promoting the purchase of organic agricultural produce from rural
communities. In addition to the Silver Theater it provides for the entertainment
of seniors, the Company also patronizes artists and humanities
organizations, enabling beneficiaries to apply their talents as widely as
possible.
It is our hope that this report on our sustainable management
activities, the second of its kind to be published, will properly inform
all stakeholders of the economic, social, and environmental efforts we
are making. We hope that this report will advertise our commitment to,
and practice of, sustainable management both inwardly and outwardly,
while also helping all the members of the Company to become ¡°warm
professionals¡± with big hearts and great capabilities.
We humbly ask you to continue to support us in our journey toward
comprehensive sustainable management with your attention and

166,SK Chemicals,2,Korea,"I really appreciate your continued interest in and support on SK chemicals.
This year, we have published our third sustainability report.
This year¡¯s report details our management¡¯s activities during the process
of pursuing our corporate mission of promoting the health of humankind
and protecting the environment of Earth. These activities are contributing to
raising sustainability of the company and entire society within the economic,
social, and environmental sectors.
We hope that this report correctly informs our external stakeholders such
as shareholders, customers, and partners of the sincerity of SK chemicals¡¯
mission.
In addition, members of SK chemicals will be able to understand how the
small effort made by us is organically connected and will crystallize into
sustainable management activities and, furthermore, contribute to the
implementation of our mission and visions.
SK chemicals¡¯ efforts to enhance its sustainability and realize its mission
in 2013 can be expounded upon in three areas ? products, culture, and the
production process.
First,
we secured infrastructure needed to produce
and sell sustainable products.
Sustainable products minimize resource use and waste generation during
their production. In addition, sustainable products hinge less on petroleumbased
materials and are free from harmful materials. SK chemicals
concentrates on R&D capabilities to make all of its products sustainable
and is pushing forward with the immediate commercialization of such
sustainable products.
The Green Chemicals Biz. Division established ¡®Initz¡¯ as a subsidiary
to assume full charge of PPS, a kind of super engineering plastic. Our
technology for PCT, another kind of super engineering plastic, was selected
as one of Korea¡¯s 10 best new technologies.
The Life Science Biz. Division is developing a cell-culture influenza vaccine
and other various premium vaccines in the vaccine business sector, one
of its growth engines. In terms of social security, the development of an
influenza vaccine based on cell culture technology is consistent with a
nation having an independent vaccine sector. Second,
we are putting sustainable corporate culture into practice with
the participation of our company¡¯s members.
In 2013, we ran the Green Point Program with all employees participating
under the theme of ¡°4G Donation Points¡±. The company matched funds for
points that employees accumulated and the money was spent on building
¡®Happiness Wells¡¯ in Kenya. This initiative raised awareness of the value of
the environment and expedited our progress toward building a happy society.
Third,
we established a sustainable production process.
L HOUSE, a state of the art vaccine plant built in Andong, North Gyeongsang
Province, obtained an LEED Gold grade, the world¡¯s first eco-friendly
certification for a pharmaceutical plant. Our Ulsan Plant specializes in
the production of eco-friendly chemical products. The plant successfully
established the Ulsan Steam Highway Project, which contributes to reducing
nation's greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption through
supplying surplus steam to companies outside. This is all done while
enjoying positive economic effects and ultimately setting up a sustainable
production system.
These efforts were duly rewarded.
In 2013, SK chemicals was recognized as a sustainably growing company
as it was included in the DJSI KOREA for four years running, came in first in
the chemical and pharmaceutical sector for the third consecutive year, and
joined the CSR KOREA 30 for the first time.
Looking ahead, SK chemicals will continue to put its utmost effort into
ceaselessly focusing on various social issues such as the environment,
contribution to communities, and social and economic polarization.
We really aspire to see our small efforts help making society happier. We
ask for your interest in our efforts and hope that you will join our efforts to
bring happiness to society. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,SK Chemicals,3,Korea," sincerely appreciate our stakeholders¡¯ unceasing support and care for SK chemicals. SK chemicals has published the fourth sustainability
report with the aim of communicating with internal and external stakeholders and notifying them about the company¡¯s management activities.
We have intended to organize the current and future value, which is necessary for the company to enhance sustainability in the process of
pursuing the company¡¯s mission and vision. I hope that this report fully conveys our sincerity in the mission, vision, and value pursued by SK
chemicals to all our external stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, and business partners. SK chemicals¡¯ employees, who are our
internal stakeholders, understand that every effort in their daily work is organically connected and materialized as activities for sustainable
management, as well as activities that contribute to executing the company¡¯s mission and vision. In this sense, I would like to let you know that
we've organized our sustainability report by separating current and future value into business and R&D in 2014 to enhance sustainability and
realize our company¡¯s mission and vision.
First, SK chemicals operates business with the concept of creating socially shared value as part of the company¡¯s vision.
To achieve its mission of ¡°promoting the health of the human race and protecting the earth¡¯s environment¡±, SK chemicals has set its vision to
achieve ¡°a great leap forward as a global leading company providing solutions for eco-friendly materials and total healthcare¡± and aims to create
value for stakeholders by developing suitable products. ¡°Sustainable products¡± pursued by SK chemicals include ¡°products with eco-friendly
materials¡±, which not only minimize resource consumption and waste but also reduce dependency on oil-based raw material and refrain from
using hazardous materials, ¡°total healthcare products¡± representing people¡¯s desire to lead long and healthy lives. Second, SK chemicals aims to enhance the company¡¯s future value by carrying out research and development activities.
The current value is a result of previous efforts, while the future value will be created from the efforts of today. The yardstick for current value is
sales and profits, and that for future value is the R&D sector and investments. SK chemicals has expanded costs for R&D each year to work
towards promoting the health of the human race and protecting the earth¡¯s environment. The company has also increased the ratio of R&D from
4.5% in 2012 to 5.4% in 2013 and 6.3% in 2014 compared to sales. Considering the current status of Korean society, where most companies
have less than 2% in R&D expenses compared to sales, SK chemicals has made extensive efforts in creating future value.
Third, SK chemicals has evolved corporate culture and processes to become a sustainable organization.
The Green Point System, which launched in 2011, has allowed the company to raise awareness of the importance of voluntary work and
environmental activities by conducting social contribution and environmental management activities while moving forward to realize a happy
society.
The company has established a sustainable production system. For example, L HOUSE (vaccine plant) in Andong acquired LEED (Leadership
in Energy and Environmental Data) Gold, a first for a pharmaceutical plant, while the Ulsan Plant completed the ¡°Ulsan Steam Highway¡± project,
which contributes to reducing national GHG emissions and energy, and realizes economic effects by using biomass and providing residue steam
to external companies.
As a leading company in the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, SK chemicals will always take various social issues, such as environmental
issues, local community issues, and issues of bipolarization, to heart, and commit our utmost efforts to present solutions as a company.
We sincerely hope that our efforts help to make a happier society. We also wish that all of you reading this report will continue to give SK chemicals
your support and care as we walk on the path to a happy society together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
169,SK Hynix,1,Korea,"Dear SK hynix stakeholders, Last year was a meaningful year where the company met SK to launch the new SK hynix while overcoming the long economic recession and challenges. I am sincerely thankful for the stakeholders¡¯ unchanging love and dedication to the new SK hynix. Approaching the 30th anniversary this year, SK hynix aims for a brighter future, and will stand strong to become the ¡°world¡¯s best semiconductor company¡±. Recently, SK hynix has encountered a rapidly changing semiconductor market that requires something different than that of the past. If ¡®production cost competition¡¯ based on the technology of granulation was the main focus of competition in the past, currently the ¡®diversity¡¯ and ¡®timeliness¡¯ of the product being delivered to the customer at a set time in regards to the demand for function and quality are being emphasized as the main factors. Also, with the sustainability of the corporation that produces goods, the whole process from production to sales is being assessed in terms of social and environmental value creation, and interconnecting an integrated way of thinking is critical to corporate value. SK hynix, as a global semiconductor producing company, has endeavored to become a sustainable company that exerts social responsibility. As a result, by 2012, we were able to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes World for three consecutive years, the East Asia 30 corporations (FTSE4Good) for two consecutive years, and the Carbon Management Global Leader¡¯s Club (CDP Korean Committee) for four consecutive years. We will continue to lead, responding to the rapidly changing external environment and carrying out our responsibility as a corporate citizen. There is a saying that the future, despite being unpredictable, is the present to those who challenge and create. We promise to carry out the activities shown below in order to adapt to the new environment and establish the basis for sustainable growth based on preparation for the future through our efforts. First, we will foster sustainable development by acquiring the growth competency through technologically innovative leadership. We will go forward to prepare the next generation¡¯s software memory, by responding to the rapidly changing memory semiconductor market through acceleration in technology-focused growth based on financial stability, which is the basic requirement for sustainable growth. We will not stop to accommodate the changes in the market by combining marketing, production, R&D, and support, and develop new markets by interpreting the consumers¡¯ demand and producing the Best Solution goods. Second, we will position ourselves as a sustainable company by integrating the creation of values. Hereafter, SK hynix will pursue integrated value creation and value sharing as its sustainability management goal, which includes the consideration of the product¡¯s life cycle. In order to interconnect the company¡¯s growth with the social and environmental value creation, we will follow the right direction and reflect upon it in the establishment of our management strategy. Third, we will become a company that is trusted and respected through our ethics management culture. SK hynix will infuse ethical consciousness to employees and will actively create an ethics management culture so that the ethical consciousness can be the basis for all elements that constitute the company. In addition, as a member of society, we will take the initiative to spread the ethical culture to our stakeholders. We ask for your continuous courtesy of warm interest and encouragement. Thank you.

170,SK Hynix,3,Korea,"After committing to achieving profitability-based management and qualitative growth despite
the intensified competition in the global market, SK hynix achieved the largest performances
in sales and business profits for two consecutive years in 2014. In addition to these economic
performances, the company has made great efforts to fulfill its social and environmental
responsibility and become a trustworthy and respectable company with transparent and
ethics management.
As a result, SK hynix¡¯s efforts and performance for sustainable management have been
recognized externally. The company has been included in DJSI World, the world-renowned
CSR assessment index, for five consecutive years as well as the Gold Club of Carbon
Management Hall of Fame selected by CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) for two consecutive
years, and received the prize from the 2nd Most Trusted Company in Korea by the
government.
Published as the 8th report, SK hynix Sustainability Report includes external needs and
interests in detail by selecting nine major issues by conducting a feasibility study regarding
the company and similar industries as well as interview and survey for stakeholders. I believe
that the value of a respected company can be found in fair and transparent management
activities which are built up from an unhidden foundation. SK hynix has not only strengthened
ethics management activities at home and abroad but also strived to share corporate
value with society based on its responsibility for the environment and win-win growth with
suppliers.
By developing eco-friendly products with high energy efficiency and saving energy in the
process, SK hynix has shared environmental and economic value with society and expanded
the company¡¯s ethics management value and guidelines to the entire business including CSR
consulting and operation of various programs to strengthen capability of suppliers. Further,
to help employees to work in a safer environment, the company has strengthened the overall
industrial safety system by reorganizing the health and safety environment and operating an
Industrial Health Verification Committee, which consists of internal and external experts.
For sustainable growth of SK hynix, support and interest from stakeholders give significant
help. I hope you give continuous support and care for SK hynix¡¯s continuous endeavors

567,SK Hynix,4,Korea,"By publishing the ninth sustainability report, I am glad to introduce SK hynix's sustainability
management aiming for challenges and changes. Through this report, SK hynix has
been endeavoring to improve its corporate competitiveness and to fulfill its social and
environmental responsibility.
Despite the rapidly changing global market and growing competition, SK hynix achieved
sales of 18.8 trillion won and operating profit of 5.3 trillion won in 2015, the best
performance for three consecutive years. In addition, we have been included in DJSI World
for six consecutive years and have been selected by CDP in the Leaders Club of Carbon
Management Hall of Fame for three consecutive years. Not being satisfied with such
achievements, we, as a semiconductor leader, will do our best to become a more trustworthy
and respectable company.
To achieve this, we are making efforts to create eco-friendly and safe campuses based
on our responsibility for the environment, human health, and safety. We are conducting
various forms of research to reduce the environmental impact on all production processes.
Especially in the semiconductor process, we are applying advanced technology to improve
energy efficiency, developing eco-friendly products, and endeavoring to acquire carbon
labeling certification for major products.
In addition, we are focusing on constructing a safe working environment for employees at
SK hynix and employees of suppliers. We are conducting various safety-training programs
to respond to unexpected situations and accidents, and seeking to secure objectivity and
professionalism by operating the Industrial Health Verification Committee consisting of
stakeholders from various groups and academic circles.
Based on our management philosophy of win-win growth and sharing, we are striving for
a healthy coexistence with our suppliers and communities as a member of society. We
are aiming for win-win growth with our suppliers through various programs such as the
technology performance sharing system, and are encouraging them to practice humanity,
environmental, and society-centered management. We are conducting technology-centered
social contribution activities fitting the corporate characteristics in the local community,
and supporting global sustainability standards such as UN Global Compact, Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).SK hynix will keep strengthening its technology leadership as a foundation for sustainable
growth and seek new challenges in order to gain stakeholders' trust through contribution
to economic development, social contribution, and ethics management. Your continuous

171,SK Innovation,1,Korea,"We published this report as a means of communication with our stakeholders
regarding our management activities in the triple bottom-line of economic,
social and environmental areas. First, our remarkable achievements in
sustainability management activities throughout 2012 should be attributed to
the continued support of our stakeholders. We would now like to report the
details of our sustainability management efforts and performance for the year.
Reinforcing global competitiveness through tireless innovation
Commemorating its 50th anniversary in 2012, SK Innovation declared its
commitment to the next phase in order to grow into a leading global energy
company. To begin with, we have focused on sharpening our competitive
edge in our existing business areas, while continuing investment in new
growth engines and pursuing overseas markets.
In order to strengthen our competitiveness in existing businesses, we carried
out enormous facility investment at our Incheon complex, broke ground
for a new PX plant at the Ulsan complex, completed a third LBO plant, and
commenced construction of an LBO plant in Cartagena, Spain. In regards to
overseas resource development projects, we contribute to the stable supply
of crude oil to the domestic market from our 24 blocks in 16 countries and 4
LNG projects around the world. Furthermore, we are actively investing in our
future through an EV battery plant in Seosan and LiBS/TAC/FCCL I/M plants in
Jeungpyeong.
Meeting global standards in safety, health and environment
management
A leading global company meets global standards not only in financial
performance but all the triple bottom lines, especially safety, health and
environment (SHE) management practices. Keenly aware of this, SK Innovation
established a SHE Group under direct control of the CEO and redefined its SHE
policy in 2012. At the same time, we upgraded our SHE management system
and plan to revise SHE procedures applicable to individual worksites. While
closely communicating with the workforce about management¡¯s dedication
to safety at work, the company runs internal audit and regular check-ups in
order to establish global-leading safety practices within the organization.Furthermore, we continue to invest in eco-friendly products and renewable
energy R&D activities in order to identify sustainable energy sources while
protecting the environment. Most conspicuously, we have developed
a pollutant-free, coal-based energy technology, Green Coal, and CO2-
based eco-friendly plastic technology GreenPolTM, and are preparing for
commercialization. In a bid to address climate change, we are working on a
greenhouse gas energy management system and low-carbon management system. In addition, our next-generation solar cell and non-edible plant-based
bio fuel technologies will provide us with a competitive edge and leadership
in the future market, where green technology will emerge as the new norm.
Reaching out to community with a caring mind
A happy society is the ultimate goal of all our business activities at SK
Innovation. In fact, SK Innovation has taken the initiative in regards to social
enterprises in Korea. Since the establishment of a childcare program back in
2006, we have established and supported several social enterprises, including
Mezzanine I-Pack, Mezzanine Eco-1, Helping Hands and Happy Farm. SK
Innovation was also the first Korean company to foster a social enterprise
outside of Korea. Yachaywash, a social farming enterprise in Peru, is the only
global social enterprise to be established by a Korean company.
To SK Innovation, our SME suppliers are important partners to our
competitiveness. Hence, we provide various support in order to help them
enhance their competitiveness. SK Global Chemical took the initiative by
creating a financial aid fund for our business partners totaling KRW 34
billion. We also run several joint technology R&D projects with SME suppliers
to localize key equipment and seek to file for co-patents with our business
partners. This allows us to develop high value-added products and advance
into global markets hand-in-hand with our partners. Above all, we maintain
close communications with the local community and society so as to create a
trust-based relationship with them, as befitting a socially responsible corporate
citizen.
Distinguished stakeholders,
Today, a new chapter at SK Innovation is unfolding. Under the clear goal
of becoming a technology-driven innovative company, we will ceaselessly
pursue change and innovation to secure our future growth engines and grow
into a globally competitive energy and chemical company. To ensure our
stakeholders¡¯ happiness, SK Innovation will never stop listening to what you
have to say and will reflect your feedback in our business activities.

industry, such as data market expansion and accelerated convergence across all industrial boundaries. Upon completion of the
LTE network nationwide, SK Telecom cemented its position through continuously successful outcomes, such as holding the
largest market share by becoming the first Korean mobile operator to surpass 10 million LTE subscribers, inclusion in the DJSI
World index for 5 consecutive years, being selected as the leader in the global mobile telecommunications sector for 3 years
straight, and topping the National Customer Satisfaction Index for 16 consecutive years. Furthermore, with the spin-off of SK
planet to strengthen our platform capabilities in response to the changing ICT environment, SK Telecom successfully launched
SK hynix in February, 2012, and completed its business portfolio as a total ICT company consisting of the three components of
hardware, platform, and network. Such restructuring has led to business results, such as SK hynix's credit rating upgraded by S&P
and Moody's, two global credit rating agencies.
SK Telecom has advocated the United Nations (UN) ""Sustainable Development Goals"" and, in 2008, formed the Corporate
Citizenship Committee under the Board of Directors as the highest-level body responsible for social responsibility. It was part
of SK Telecom's effort to practice social responsibility across all areas, including Customer Satisfaction, Win-Win Growth,
Social Responsibility, Ethics and Compliance, and Environmental Management. SK Telecom also enhanced its reputation on
the global stage: in 2012, at the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The company
hosted the social enterprise session and gave a presentation regarding building a global IT platform for social enterprises. At the
ITU Symposium on ICTs, the Environment and Climate Change, the ""Methodology for Estimating the Effects of Greenhouse
Gas Reductions Using ICTs"" implemented by SK Telecom was adopted as an international standard. SK Telecom will continue
to help create social value by incorporating into its business activities global standards for corporate social responsibility
suggested by the UN Global Compact (UNGC).
The Vision 2020: Partner for New Possibilities, declared in February, 2012, represents SK Telecom's commitment to creating an
ICT ecosystem where it can work with customers, business partners, and communities to achieve sustainable development. To
implement Vision 2020, the company announced ""Happy Companion"" in May this year to realize ""Happiness"" with customers
and ""Companion"" with society. Through ""Happy Companion"", SK Telecom, a leading Korean ICT company, will drive
economic and social changes, realize the best customer value, and try our utmost to become a socially responsible, respected
company that contributes to Win-Win growth and job creation. When society and companies explore new possibilities for a better world, SK Telecom will always stand by and work with them
to be ""Happy Companion"". Your continued support and attention will be greatly appreciated.

the telecommunications industry is rapidly shifting from voice to data. In 2013,
SK Telecom strengthened its leadership by changing the competitive paradigm
to one that is focused on customer value, and achieved meaningful results in
IPTV, healthcare and other growth businesses.
The increase in LTE subscribers and growth of the B2B solution improved
SK Telecom¡¯s revenue by 2.9% year-on-year to KRW 16.6 trillion in 2013.
Furthermore, by refraining from subsidy competition and increasing the focus
on differentiated service-based competition, operating profit increased 16.2%

In addition to the financial achievements, SK Telecom solidified its foundation
for sustained growth. The company actively engaged in LEAD, which is
composed of a select group of outstanding UN Global Compact (UNGC)
companies, was included in the DJSI (Down Jones Sustainability Indices) World
Index for the sixth consecutive year, received the highest ¡°excellent¡± rating
from the Win-Win Growth Index, and was ranked first in the 2014 National

Competitive Paradigm Shift to Customer Value
The driving force behind SK Telecom in 2013 was customer value. Under the
banner of ¡°creating the best customer value,¡± SK Telecom focused its resources
to shift the competitive paradigm to that based on services and products.
SK Telecom led the introduction of innovative price plans including ¡°T kkiri Price
Plan¡± and ¡°Data Gift,¡± and enriched the user experience by expanding benefits
for long-term subscribers. Moreover, by launching the world¡¯s first LTE-A
service, the company further differentiated its network to create customer value,

of year-end 2013, representing 49% of SK Telecom¡¯s subscriber base.Confidence in Future Growth of New Businesses
SK Telecom has laid the foundation for its growth businesses in 2013.
The company is confident of the growth prospects for IPTV and healthcare
businesses, has enhanced the competitiveness of the B2B solution business,
and continues to invest in the area of cloud computing and big data. Indeed,
the B2B solution businesses recorded a 60% year-on-year growth, positioning
itself as the company¡¯s growth driver. In addition to identifying new growth
businesses, the expansion of SK Planet and the improved competitiveness of
SK Hynix have positioned SK Telecom as a leading ICT company.
Pursuing ¡°Happy Companion¡± to Achieve ¡°Vision 2020¡±
In 2012, SK Telecom announced ¡°Vision 2020,¡± its long-term objectives for

Customers¡± and ¡°Companion with Society¡± programs. As part of the ¡°Happiness
with Customers¡± program, the company launched products and services that
base key values on ¡°family¡± and ¡°safety.¡± By launching services that alert
customers of illegal smishing and spam messages, and other services for
children and senior citizens, the company has taken the lead in creating a safer
telecommunications environment.
¡°Companion with Society¡± is a program to identify new business opportunities
and grow the ICT ecosystem by providing a firm platform for start-up
companies. To this end, the company actively invested in B2B solution,
healthcare and other emerging convergence businesses, and utilized big data
to stimulate growth of the ICT ecosystem. Through the ¡°BRAVO! Restart¡±
program, which provides support for new business ventures by retirees and
the ¡°Traditional Market Revitalization¡± project utilizing ICT tools, the company
also contributed to the collective improvement of society. In fact, these two
programs received national recognition as best practice cases of Korea¡¯s

Letter to Stakeholders
Securing leadership in LTE by strengthening the core competitiveness
of its telecommunications business
SK Telecom strengthened the core competitiveness of its telecommunications business in
2014 by innovating products¡¤services, and continuously pushed forward to bring about a paradigm
shift in the competitive environment. The company offered differentiated network competitiveness
and specialized services that focused on customer values, and these efforts led to
an increase in LTE subscribers. To create a paradigm shift in the competition, SK Telecom also
played a leading role in stabilizing the market in a rapidly changing regulatory environment that
included the implementation of the Mobile Device Distribution Improvement Act. New services
that aimed at optimizing customer needs, including ¡°T Phone¡±, the ¡°Unlimited Membership¡±
plan and ¡°T Kids Phone¡±, were also introduced. By using these services, customers gained
increased awareness of how efficient data really is. The company also further solidified its posi
-
tion as the LTE market leader by commercializing the 3band LTE-A. SK Telecom¡¯s efforts were
well rewarded as it saw continuous increase in the number of LTE subscribers. By the end of
2014, 16.74 million or 58.5% of its total subscribers were using LTE services. Preparing a foundation for the future by expanding growth businesses
SK Telecom strengthened its foundation for growth by expanding business models and
boosting synergy around the three major growth areas of IPTV, healthcare and B2B solutions.
The company also achieved qualitative growth by increasing the size of its business operations.
The IPTV division secured 5.2 million fixed line and wireless subscribers by late 2014,
solidifying the company¡¯s position as the main paid broadcasting service provider and creating
a foundation to expand its business model into the media sector. The company¡¯s healthcare
division acquired US FDA approval for its external diagnostic device and opened a medical
center, which will be used as a basecamp for future strategic growth, in Shenzhen, China. The
company¡¯s B2B solution business, which achieved a year-over-year increase of 20% in sales,
is expected to record steady sales growth as SK Telecom continuously develops B2B solutions
and platforms that are centered on Internet of Things (IoT), energy reducing green solutions
and security solutions.
Moreover, SK Telecom successfully acquired iriver and NSOK. The company also laid down
a sturdy foundation for future growth and made continuous and noteworthy achievements in
the global market, including SK Planet¡¯s entry into international markets of Turkey, the United
States of America and Indonesia, as well as SK Hynix¡¯s remarkable growth.
Pursuing social values through ¡®Creative Economy¡¯ innovations
SK Telecom dreams of ¡°changing society for the better¡± with the evolution and development
of ICT. SK Telecom has promoted pilot projects to construct the Daejeon Center for Creative
Economy and Innovation and the Sejong Changjo (Creative) Village since 2014 in cooperation
with the public and private sectors. These efforts were made to implement the ¡°Creative Economy¡±,
the new growth engine for the Korean economy. SK Telecom has played an unsparing
role in the Daejeon Center for Creative Economy and Innovation by providing outstanding
startup companies with support in developing their business models and products, securing
markets and making entries into global markets. SK Telecom¡¯s work attracted the government¡¯s
cooperation and visible results were produced when the Daejeon Center for Creative
Economy and Innovation¡¯s business model was exported to Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, SK Telecom contributed in the development of the ICT ecosystem. Through
the ¡°BRAVO! Restart¡± program, the company supported small-sized startups which all have
innovative technologies in the area of Internet of Things and big data. The project succeeded
in commercializing 21 teams, and as a result, partners witnessed a genuine growth in sales.
SK Telecom¡¯s efforts continued with the ¡°Upright ICT Class¡±, which was held to create a
healthy ICT culture by providing correct understanding of technology and preventing internet
addiction. The ¡°Good ICT¡± project was conducted to reduce the digital divide and resolve side
effects that accompanied technical developments, such as personal information protection
issues. Creating new ICT history in 2015 by innovating corporate values
SK Telecom announced the ¡°Vision 2020¡± initiative in 2012 under the slogan of ¡°Partner
for New Possibilities¡±. Under the Vision 2020 initiative, SK Telecom set a long-term goal of
becoming one of the world¡¯s top 100 companies with a corporate value of 100 trillion by 2020.
In order to achieve these goals in advance, SK Telecom will transform its businesses into new
areas and take the first step towards innovating corporate value.
World-class efficiency and competitiveness has to be secured to overcome the crisis faced by
the telecommunication industry today. Efficiency and competitiveness can be acquired through
structural change and innovation, reform, and by improving the way work is done. Therefore,
SK Telecom will transform into a ¡°Next-Generation Platform¡± provider in order to maximize
customer values and discover new growth engines to create a turning point in the history of
Korean ICT development.
SK Telecom aims to become a new ¡°Next-Generation Platform¡±, a new platform that builds an
open ecosystem that is based on telecommunications and provides innovative products and
services that satisfies customers¡¯ innermost needs. The company has changed its perspective
from a service provider¡¯s perspective to the user¡¯s perspective, and formed cooperative relationships
with many partners including venture companies, startups and small-and-medium
sized businesses under the principle of ¡°openness and sharing¡±.
SK Telecom will create innovation that does not draw a line between industry boundaries
and will expand the ICT ecosystem. The company will also lead a healthy competitive culture
that is based on core competitiveness and customer confidence. In 2015, SK Telecom will
innovate corporate values through strong performance. Through such innovation, SK Telecom
will continue to play a pioneering role in implementing the Creative Economy and ICTnomics,
create new possibilities with stakeholders and become a company that is respected throughout
society.

568,SK Telecom,4,Korea,"The topics of interest in the telecommunications industry have moved beyond such quantitative
competitions as LTE speed and acquiring subscribers, and are rapidly evolving to that of qualitative
competition regarding products and services based upon high-quality data networks, which
provide innovative value across individuals¡¯ daily lives as well as the industry. In 2015, while
SK Telecom provided the highest levels of customer value in the business through innovative
products and services and led the data-centered market, it has also built the foundation to
transform into a three platform business centered on Lifestyle Enhancement, Media and IoT
that is based upon the capabilities and assets of the telecommunications business. As a result
of these efforts, SK Telecom demonstrated financial results of KRW 17,136.7 billion in revenue
as well as KRW 1,708 billion in operating profit on a consolidated basis in 2015. In addition,
SK Telecom received the highest levels of external assessments across all of its management
activities, as demonstrated by its efforts as a United Nation Global Compact (UNGC) LEAD
company, status as the first Asian telecommunications company to be included in the Dow
Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World for the eighth consecutive year, maintenance of the
highest possible grade of ¡°Excellent¡± from the Win-Win Index for the third consecutive year,
first place rank in the National Customer Satisfaction Index (NCSI) for 19 years in a row, and
first place rank in the network quality assessment of the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future
Planning.
Laying the foundation to become a next-generation platform provider
Meanwhile, as SK Telecom innovates the structure of the Mobile Network Operator with a focus
on efficiency and cements its position as the market leader, it is also focusing on the company¡¯s
core capabilities centered on the three platform areas including the ¡®Lifestyle Enhancement
Platform¡¯ that improves convenience and productivity by providing distinct value to customers
that go beyond telecommunications services; the ¡®Media Platform¡¯ that provides customized
content and a viewing experience optimized to the individual; and the ¡®IoT Platform¡¯ that
provides valuable services by expanding the connectivity of all things.
In 2015, SK Telecom launched Lifestyle Enhancement Platform services in 2015 that satisfy
segmented customer needs for a wide range of ages and lifestyles, some of which include
the customized platform ¡®Club T Kids¡¯ for parents and children and ¡®Petween¡¯ for animal
companions. The ¡®Lifestyle Enhancement Platform¡¯ service, which delivers unprecedented value
on the foundation of the core assets of mobile telecommunications, is henceforth expected to
contribute to customer base expansion in new business areas through enhanced service lineups
and packages.
At the beginning of 2016 in the media area, the successful launch of the mobile media platform
¡®oksusu,¡¯ which combines ¡®B tv mobile¡¯ and ¡®hoppin,¡¯ was based upon increased wired IPTV
subscribers and the growth of paid content revenue in 2015. SK Telecom is continuously endeavoring to build a next-generation media platform delivery environment, as demonstrated
by the 360¡Æ virtual reality service centered on ¡®oksusu,¡¯ release of exclusive content and the
introduction of ultra-low delay broadcasting technology that reduces the real-time broadcast
transmission speed up to three seconds.
In the IoT Platform area, while completing the IoT-exclusive network by building a national
network for an IoT hybrid network, SK Telecom is leading the market by collaborating
with various partners such as the city of Daegu, KEPCO and Korea University to expand
open platform business models based upon the creation of IoT ecosystems in the areas of
security¡¤energy¡¤automobiles¡¤cities. Additionally, by driving the ¡®home¡¯ strategy that encompasses
media and IoT, SK Telecom will continue to maximize the synergy and interconnectedness at the
growth stage of each next-generation platform.
Strengthening market leadership through core competitiveness as a Mobile
Network Operator
SK Telecom, which has avoided wasteful marketing competition and led the market by focusing
on customer retention, took the lead in changing the mobile telecommunication market¡¯s
competitive paradigm to one based upon the core competitiveness of products and services, as
can be seen in the increase of the proportion of handset upgrade customers to over 50% among
new and handset upgrade subscribers after the second quarter of 2015. The data-centered
¡®Band Data Rate Plan¡¯ that was introduced last May secured 7 million subscribers by the end of
the year after its launch, and as it pioneered the structural change from products and services
focused on voice calls to those focused on data, it drove the improvement of the effectiveness
of data services. In addition, the success of the end-user device LUNA opened the way for the
launch of a variety of affordable phones. The launch of a variety of products based on 2nd
devices such as the Joon Kids Phone and T Pet led to an impressive 86.6% share (according to
the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) of the wearables market by the end of 2015,
attesting to SK Telecom¡¯s differentiated competitiveness.
Creating integrated social-corporate value through responsibility management
SK Telecom has supported the implementation of the ¡®Creative Economy,¡¯ which is the new
growth driver of the national economy, and is promoting public-private cooperative businesses
through the Sejong¡¤Daejeon Center for Creative Economy and Innovation. The ¡®Creative
Village,¡¯ which was jointly founded by SK Telecom and the Sejong Center for Creative Economy
and Innovation, is considered an outstanding example of effectively increasing agricultural
competitiveness and convenience through ICT technology and smart networks. The ICT
convergence venture support project, known as the ¡®BRAVO! Restart¡¯ program, has both
contributed to the discovery of new growth drivers for SK Telecom and is also an integrated
value creation program that unites ICT capabilities and plays a role in solving social problems.
By the end of 2015, a total of 34 teams received support from SK Telecom and their results
were evidenced by product releases, patent applications and expansion into global markets,
leading social innovation through ICT technology.As international efforts to respond to climate change bore fruit with the signing of the Paris
Agreement, it is anticipated that climate change and energy issues will go beyond general
corporate social responsibility to become new areas of opportunity. SK Telecom exercises its
environmental responsibility not only in terms of building low-power networks and reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the course of business, but also by actualizing energyrelated
growth business models. In this regard, the ¡®SK Telecom-KEPCO Collaboration Center¡¯ in
Naju, South Jeolla Province that was established through a long-term partnership with KEPCO
for new energy businesses will serve as a valuable example. Beginning with the development
of wireless charging facilities for the automobiles of the future and services to expand ICT
infrastructure, SK Telecom will not only leverage eco-friendly ICT technology to reduce GHG
and energy usage, but also has a vision to fuse such technology with the development of
department stores, universities, and cities to discover growth opportunities in new dimensions.
Corporate value innovation through business transformation and performance
turnaround
In 2016, SK Telecom steadfastly built up the appropriate capabilities for the platform businesses
in terms of talent, infrastructure, and services. By effecting structural changes and innovation
in its business, and having a robust organizational culture marked by speed and skill, SK
Telecom came to possess world-class efficiency and competitiveness, and is now pursuing its
successful transformation into a platform provider.
SK Telecom, which has pioneered Korea¡¯s mobile telecommunications history thus far,
possesses a sound competitive culture due to its core competitiveness and customer
trust. Thereby, as the company leads the expansion of the ICT ecosystem and leads innovation
that goes beyond competition, it will continue to advance and grow. SK Telecom will effectively
deliver the highest values to customers through its successful transformation as a ¡®nextgeneration
platform provider.¡¯ Furthermore, the company will innovate its corporate value
by the momentum of the platform businesses¡¯ performance, while at the same time playing a
pivotal role in the country¡¯s future ICT development.

stakeholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last year, 2012, was a tough, but historic time for S-OIL. Despite a stagnant global economic recovery and stiff fluctuations
in crude prices, our financial performance was solid with our highest sales ever ? 30.8 billion USD ? on a decent operating
income of 694 million USD. Our presence both in local and overseas markets increased with a record-high local market share
of more than 18% and the export of our products to more than 30 countries around the world.
Safety remains our first priority, which we will never compromise. Through our persistence, we have had seven million accident-free
man-hours for as long as 709 days since May 10, 2010. S-OIL is the first and only local refiner who acquired the
Safety-zone Certificate from the government.
We also devoted more attention to protecting and preserving the Mother Nature. We reduced carbon emissions by 149 thousand
tons of CO2 in a year, which is 2% less than the previous year. As a trusted corporate citizen of the global village, S-OIL
supports the efforts of international and local communities to address climate change and willingly participates in activities
that tackle such issues.
Valued Stakeholders and staunch supporters of S-OIL,
All officers and employees of S-OIL work as a team, not a single member. We all care about your expectations and will continue
to listen to your voice. I have a vision and strategies that are aligned to satisfy your ultimate expectations, Sustainable
Profitable Growth of S-OIL.

integration with petrochemicals, and new energy business. Along this journey, as we successfully fulfill our vision, S-OIL

uncertainties in the business environment and drive sustainable growth. To this end, we
are bolstering our competitive edge in existing businesses and keeping a close eye on

The cracked oil tank incident at S-OIL¡¯s Onsan Refinery in April 2014 was a wake-up call
to remind all of us at S-OIL about the magnitude of the impact our business activities
can have on the environment and local communities. The Company took counteractions
in a timely manner by faithfully observing risk management procedures with which we
held regular drills, thus leaving no casualties or marine pollution. All officers and employees
at S-OIL are clearly aware of the expectations stakeholders have for the Company¡¯s
role in keeping communities safe and the environment clean. As a responsible corporate

In the face of uncertainties persisting in the business landscape, S-OIL has maintained
a balanced triple bottom line of sustainability in economic, environmental and social
aspects, of which efforts are well presented in this Report. Particularly, I would like to
share with you the following key initiatives:
First, S-OIL strives to generate economic value as a means to fulfill our fundamental
duties as a corporate citizen. Currently, we are conducting the SUPER (S-OIL Upgrading
Program of Existing Refinery) project, to enhance the operational efficiency of existing
manufacturing facilities. The Company is also developing a large-scale project to construct
integrated refinery-petrochemical complexes and bolster TS&D (Technical Service
and Development) capabilities. The completion of these projects will let us make greater
contributions to sustainable development of the Korean economy and local communities
by creating quality jobs and high added value. In addition, S-OIL will move closer
toward its grand vision to become the most profitable and integrated energy company
encompassing refining, lube, and petrochemical business.
Second, S-OIL spares no efforts in protecting the Mother Nature. Company-wide energy
saving activities allowed us to cut carbon emissions by around 9% over the past
three years. S-OIL also undertakes ecology preservation programs in earnest to protect

569,S-OIL,4,Korea,"I take pleasure in presenting the 9th Sustainability Report to update you on the progress
we are making on our journey towards sustainability management.
The year 2015 has seen deepening global income polarization, youth unemployment,
and climate change. The challenges further sparked a global interest of the importance
of sustainable development. A glaring example is the United Nations which adopted the
Sustainable Development Goals highlighting tasks on such issues as economic growth,
job creation, and climate change. Particularly, the intergovernmental organization has
set forth new sustainable growth agenda when it adopted Paris Agreement aimed at
encouraging the humanity to fight climate change.
S-OIL made a concerted effort to cope with this trend in 2015 as well. We finally decided
to push forward the construction of integrated refinery-petrochemical complexes,
the largest-ever mega project since our foundation. Through the project, we expect to
secure the next growth engine while generating decent jobs for the community and contributing
to the national economy.
We proactively joined the global community in addressing climate change as we keep
investing to enhance energy efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We
also faithfully participated in the emission trade system introduced locally since 2015.
Our extraordinary social contribution activities have helped disseminate the value of
sharing across the nation.
The year 2016 marks the 40th anniversary of our foundation. Our company will pay full
attention to carrying out the largest-ever new project without setbacks. We will also
dedicate ourselves to sustainability management as we have strived to deliver balanced
economic, environmental, and social values. Furthermore, we pledge to fulfill the responsibilities
required of a global corporate citizen to abide by international commitments
such as the ¡®Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact¡¯ and the ¡®UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights¡¯.
Your lasting encouragement and help would be greatly appreciated as we work to reach
the goal of sustainability management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We made important strides in advancing our mission in 2014. Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) story gives you a clear view of our comprehensive approach. It demonstrates how we make healthier days possible by focusing on building healthier communities, innovating to deliver product and service solutions, fostering a healthy environment, and developing our people. Our CSR commitment is firmly rooted in a few core beliefs. We believe in innovation and new approaches to familiar challenges, and in driving excellence in all we do. We believe in acting with understanding and compassion, and we focus on doing the right thing for the right reason. We believe in taking a holistic approach to CSR ? going beyond our charter to find the best way to improve the health of people and communities. It¡¯s vital that we not only provide quality products and services to consumers, but that we invest in the social services needed to eliminate barriers to achieving health goals. We believe in enabling the best possible health across the spectrum of age and health conditions ? not just connecting members to quality care when they face serious health problems, but creating and promoting wellness programs to help people stay well. And, we believe in making health care simpler and easy to use, removing one of the biggest obstacles to true engagement in health. We¡¯ve put these beliefs into action with initiatives that touch the lives of millions. This report demonstrates how. For example, we believe so much in the power of value-based care that we have committed to seeing 75 percent of our claim dollars coming from value-based care arrangements by 2020. Thinking in nontraditional ways, we also increased the minimum base wage of our U.S. employees and improved their health benefits to help drive employee engagement and create a better experience for our customers. We view each and every one of our numerous initiatives as important building blocks for healthier families, healthier communities and a healthier world. As a responsible corporate citizen, we are committed to realizing this potential by driving healthy change not just in the marketplace but across our sphere of influence.

2 2012 AEP Corporate Accountability Report
A Message from the President & CEO
Dear Friends: I am pleased to share American Electric Power¡¯s 2012 Corporate Accountability Report, my ?rst as president and chief executive of?cer. We are opening a new, exciting chapter in our 106-year history. Fundamental change is occurring in our company and our industry that will have lasting impacts on our communities, our customers and our environment; on how we produce, consume and move electricity around the grid and within our system; and what it will cost now and in the future. Yet, at the beginning, middle and end of the day, the power that our customers rely on must be there when and where they need it. We are proud to have delivered quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously for more than a century. We have a strong balance sheet, investment-grade credit ratings and tight control over spending. We understand the social and economic value of electricity to our service territory and to society at large.  We manage our system as a strategic asset that is fundamental 
agement that create long-term value. We will continue to identify speci?c, integral connections between our balance sheet, our daily operations and our responsibility to the environment and to society. By treating sustainability as a strategic investment, we expect to demonstrate that the strength and durability of these connections are vital to our growth and our long-term success. We believe this underpins our ability to deliver 4 percent to 6 percent annual earnings growth on average.  The ?rst part of our strategy is to invest in our regulated utilities and optimize returns on those investments. Our 11 states have different regulatory frameworks, customer bases and weather patterns that make our operating and investment ?exibility a strength that we will leverage. We will look closely at each operating company to determine where we can earn the best return, and our decisions will be tied to making those investments and companies as successful as possible.  We have changed our business model to provide our operating companies with more in?uence at the corporate level and more 
autonomy at the local level to enable better, more locally attuned business decisions.  The second part of our strategy is to reposition our generation assets for a more sustainable fuel mix. Several factors are driving us in this direction, including new environmental regulations; the economics of coal versus natural gas; the operating cost, age and ef?ciency of some coal units; increased competition; and grid reliability. We will retire more than 5,100 megawatts ( MW ) of coal-?red generation and retro?t nearly 11,000 MW with new, advanced pollution controls or upgrade existing control equipment. Additional coal-?red generation may be refueled with natural gas.  Even as we add more natural gas to our portfolio, coal will continue to be a critical resource. The startup in January 2012 of the 580MW Dresden combined-cycle gas plant in Ohio, and completion of the 600-MW coal-fueled John W. Turk Jr. Plant in Arkansas later this year, re?ect this move toward a sustainable balance. We are advocating for the regulatory ?exibility to minimize both the cost burden of this transition on our customers and the economic impact on our communities, while achieving the desired environmental outcomes. 
The third part of our strategy is to grow our short- and long-term earnings through our transmission business. We are changing our strategy regarding transmission; in the near term, our new AEP transmission companies will invest more than $ 2 billion during the next four years on projects to enhance our transmission system. Our long-term transmission strategy includes development of larger interstate projects through our joint ventures across the country. Larger projects can create bene?ts for customers. As regional grids are upgraded or connected to new lines, access to energy improves. This results in better reliability, greater availability of renewable energy, and downward pressure on prices. The fourth part of our strategy is to create a robust competitive retail business that can reduce business risk while providing signi?cant growth potential. Customer switching has become a growing concern, ?nancially and operationally, in Ohio. The creation of AEP Retail Energy and the acquisition of BlueStar Energy Holdings Inc. strengthen our 
fuel mix and address aging plants and facilities across our system. This will be costly and require rate increases, which affects our customers.  Our tasks are made all the more dif?cult, lengthy and expensive by the lack of a comprehensive national energy policy. Our industry must deal with and try to reconcile uncoordinated and often con?icting policy and regulatory decisions emanating from different federal agencies or from the many state and local agencies that have oversight. Some of this con?ict is inevitable, but much of it creates unnecessary confusion, delay and costs that are borne by customers and shareholders.  The ambiguity around issues such as proposed environmental regulations and the transition in Ohio to a competitive market are good examples of the challenges we face. We need a clearer path forward in the future to make the decisions and investments we now face. The lack of coordination among federal and state regulators is a matter of increasing concern for our shareholders, our customers and our communities. We have spent much time and effort to ensure that 
ability  to compete in Ohio as well as other competitive markets and provide customers with customized products and services from a competitive platform. This is an ambitious strategy and it will not be an easy road to travel, but I am con?dent that we have the right game plan, a strong operating model and the talent to execute our plan and achieve our ?nancial goals. As with all of our commitments, we will hold ourselves accountable for results. 
New Risks, New Opportunities We face new realities and a challenging transition, both as an industry and as a company. But I am con?dent we will navigate this transition successfully. We must manage a combination of economic, business, social, environmental, political and regulatory risks at the federal, state and local levels. These include a slower-than-expected economic recovery; intense competition in the competitive parts of our business; and burdensome government regulations that will necessitate the premature retirement of coal-?red generating units in six states, causing further economic hardship. We must, at the same time, diversify our 
our state regulators and legislators know about national policies that affect our customers and their constituents. Our need for clarity about energy policy is made even more urgent because, unlike most private-sector companies, the prices we and other electric utilities can charge our customers, and the returns we can earn on our investments, are determined by state and federal regulators. If we make investments and are not allowed to recover our costs or earn a reasonable rate of return on those investments, the company¡¯s earnings suffer and our shareholders may lose value. We stepped forward as a clear leader in our industry on certain environmental issues, such as climate change and greenhouse gas reductions, because we believe in the importance and potential long-term bene?t of developing solutions such as carbon capture and storage. Unfortunately, our efforts were penalized when regulators rejected our request to recover the cost of those investments. We took a $ 76 million write-off, for example, on our carbon capture and storage projects in West Virginia. We still believe there will be bene?ts from our work in developing this technology, but we can¡¯t afford to move ahead with it at this time.Market Changes Our shift to natural gas and other resources re?ects a market change. A key factor is the recent development of massive shale gas formations throughout the United States, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices. In fact, natural gas prices have been consistently low for the past two years. Another signi?cant factor is the prospect of major environmental compliance investments in coal units, driving up the cost of coal-?red electricity. By 2020, we estimate natural gas will account for 27 percent of AEP¡¯s generating capacity, compared with 24 percent today. At the same time, we expect our coal capacity to decrease to about 50 percent of our total capacity by 2020, compared with 67 percent in 2011. The remainder of our fuel portfolio will consist of nuclear, renewables, hydro and pumped storage and energy ef?ciency. This effort to create a more sustainable balance of our generation assets will be challenging and expensive but will provide long-term fuel stability and allow us 
for AEP. However, this all depends on regulatory support for our smart grid investments. In 2008, we set an aggressive goal to install 5 million smart meters by the end of 2015. Unfortunately, a combination of factors slowed this effort. We found that regulators are reluctant to allow rate increases associated with these new technologies, especially in a dif?cult economy. We also learned that it takes time for customers to adapt to completely new ways of thinking about how they use electricity. Through 2011, we have deployed more than 612,000 smart meters, along with many other smart grid technologies and customer programs. We will continue to pursue our existing gridSMART ¢ç objectives and expand where and when regulators give us the go-ahead.
Addressing Climate Change Although global climate change has lost ground politically in the United States, we continue to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Many aspects to adapt to the major upcoming market and operational changes. 
Modernizing Our Grid Upgrading to a smart grid is no longer a luxury; it is an important step toward a more ef?cient energy delivery system that can meet customers¡¯ needs now and in the future. Through our gridSMART ¢ç initiative, AEP is preparing to meet these challenges with a comprehensive undertaking that will rede?ne the way we operate our distribution 
 grid and revolutionize how we interact with customers. With distribution grid technology, AEP is improving reliability and service restoration for customers.  We have proven that we can achieve substantial energy ef?ciency without affecting customers through the use of voltage management on our grid. Our smart meters are enabling two-way communication with our customers, sending them price signals that allow them to make more informed decisions about their energy use. Smart appliances and other technologies such as plug-in electric vehicles will provide exciting new options for customers. All of these advancements will result in energy and cost savings for customers and business opportunities 
of our business strategy will help lower AEP¡¯s greenhouse gas emissions even further. Limiting emissions of greenhouse gases is a global challenge that requires a global solution. AEP is committed to being part of that solution through effective environmental stewardship. Our goal is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent from 2010 levels by 2020. We will meet or exceed this goal as we retire coal-?red units. Every coal-derived megawatt-hour we replace with natural gas will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by about 50 percent. Even so, we anticipate that, ultimately, we will need to address the carbon emissions of natural gas. Technology development and deployment will be an important part of the solution. 
Meaningful Relationships Foster Informed Decision Making We truly value the working relationships we have developed with our many stakeholders over the years. We have invested time and effort to earn their trust and respect by being honest and straightforward about our thoughts, strategies, actions and impacts. We seek to collaborate, not only with customers and community leaders, but also with environmental and consumer advocates, on a range of issues including cli
A mate change, environmental regulations, reliability concerns, the cost of electricity and energy ef?ciency. Although we have not always shared common objectives with regard to environmental or other issues, we have held many discussions and have listened and tried to work cooperatively, with candor and in good faith. During the last two years, we have had some sharp disagreements and pointed conversations about the appropriate balance between economic development and reliability issues on the one hand, and environmental regulations on the other. As a consequence, some of our stakeholders engaged in an anti-AEP campaign. We were the ?rst electric company to unveil our plan for compliance with proposed environmental regulations. We openly shared our concerns about reliability, the potential loss of jobs, and other adverse economic effects that premature plant retirements would have on communities in our service territory, especially in a struggling economy. While we remain at odds with some stakeholders and are disappointed in the atmosphere surrounding these relationships, we value 
seek to accomplish through our focus on zero harm. I know it can be done because many of our business units have proven that it can, by working without incident, year-in and year-out. This dedication to safety and health is the reason our overall performance has improved during the past several years. We are very proud of their commitment and honor them accordingly. Beyond safety, our future depends on a skilled work force that can quickly respond to the changing landscape around us, including the need for additional or new skills for the future. Work force planning is important to ensure we have the talent we¡¯ll need to run the company and compete aggressively in the years ahead. Although we are more focused on retention than hiring right now, we must be thoughtful and strategic about preparing our work force for the future. 
Final Thoughts Succeeding Mike Morris as CEO is an enormous challenge and privilege. Mike¡¯s leadership has left an indelible imprint on the stature of our company within the industry and the business community, and on AEP¡¯s culture. AEP is a better, stronger company because of him. I am humbled and honored to succeed Mike in his role. The longest-serving member of our board is leaving us this year. Dr. Lester A. Hudson, Jr., who was elected to the AEP Board of Directors in December 1987, is retiring. Les has brought years of business leadership experience and, more recently, academic experience to his service on behalf of AEP. His wise counsel, especially on governance issues, has been invaluable. Les has served as the board¡¯s lead director since the post was instituted in 2003. He will be sorely missed. In addition to delivering on our strategy and addressing the many challenges before us, we have many new opportunities ahead. This is an exciting time for our industry and for AEP. Change is not easy for any organization and sustainable transformation is perhaps the hardest change of all. But we are committed to being candid, straightforward, trustworthy and collaborative.  Knowing our leadership team and the men and women of AEP, I know that we are up to these challenges. We welcome your thoughts and suggestions, and we will continue to work to earn your support. With that, I ?rmly believe that we will continue to have a very bright future together.
Thank you for your interest in American Electric Power.

310,Amgen,1,USA,"As we deliver more therapies to more patients suffering
from serious illnesses around the world, it remains
critical that we do so in a way that is consistent with
our mission and our values.
Over the past 33 years, we have grown to be a leader in
biotechnology and we have reached more than 25 million
patients. During the course of that journey, innovation
has played a pivotal role. As a company, we have innovated
by discovering and developing medicines that have
dramatically improved people¡¯s lives. In addition, we
have played a pioneering role in biologics manufacturing
through scores of innovations that have enabled us to
deliver vital medicines to large patient populations.
We expect to continue transforming our manufacturing
process in the years ahead. An important part of that next
wave of manufacturing innovation will involve reducing
waste while improving efficiencies and incorporating
greater flexibility into the process. As we embark on
this exciting new chapter in our company¡¯s history,
our commitment to operating in a way that reduces
environmental impacts remains steadfast.
We achieved the targets that we set in 2008 as part of
our first environmental sustainability plan. From 2008
through 2012, we realized more than $24 million in
cost savings by implementing strategic sustainability
initiatives. And we made those conservation gains even
as we grew operations worldwide.
As part of our sustainability initiatives, our staff eliminated
waste and created efficiencies through our Green Chemistry
and Green Biology programs. We remodeled facilities for
expansion with green features, and in 2012, we achieved
a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
Gold designation for an Amgen building. Our initial
integration of environmental sustainability principles into
our products and processes will form the foundation of
our second environmental sustainability plan, beginning
in 2013, which will take us through 2020.
I view the state-of-the-art manufacturing facility we are
planning in Singapore as the best example to date of how
our growth intersects with our environmental sustainability
goals. This innovative, new facility is expected to conserve
resources and save costs, thereby contributing to the
consistent supply of safe and effective medicines to
patients who need them.
Staff members, who are passionate about our mission,
represent our most important resource. Creating a supportive
work environment that keeps them safe and well is a
primary part of our culture. We have a comprehensive
and effective set of wellness programs for staff as well
as one of the best safety records in our industry.

311,Amgen,2,USA,"Amgen ensures we live up to our commitment to environmental sustainability by establishing a multi-year plan with clear metrics to track our progress. Through our first environmental sustainability plan, we realized more than $24 million in cost savings and exceeded targets for conservation, even as our operations grew. In 2013, we embarked on a new environmental sustainability plan with more ambitious conservation targets. These include aspirations to reduce facility carbon emissions by 10 percent and disposed waste by 35 percent from a 2012 baseline. This plan aims to thoroughly integrate principles of environmental sustainability into the development of our medicines from early research to the market. In 2013, we were also recognized externally for our results. Ranked among the best performers in biotechnology, Amgen was listed on the 2013 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (DJSI). Amgen is widely recognized as a leader in biologics manufacturing and we continue to advance our capabilities in this area. We broke ground in 2013 in Singapore on a facility that will help transform manufacturing processes at Amgen. We expect the facility will enable us to be faster, more flexible, and more efficient in reaching patients, while also reducing the environmental impact of the manufacturing of our products. When up and running, this facility will join existing efforts in both biologic and synthetic molecule research and development to make us more agile and environmentally responsible as a company. Beyond the specific actions we¡¯ve taken as a company, our staff continue to demonstrate their passion for the environment through innovative thinking on the job and volunteer work in the community. We support staff safety with a pervasive focus on creating a safe work environment, and we promote staff wellness with a range of programs that encourage physical and mental health.

312,Amgen,3,USA,"I am pleased to provide you with Amgen¡¯s 2014
Environmental Sustainability report. Amgen is at a very
exciting time in its history. We are preparing to launch
new medicines for patients suffering from serious illness
and expanding the reach of our existing medicines as
we enter new geographies. We are innovating new ways
to manufacture medicines, and we are introducing new
technologies to deliver these medicines to patients.
This is important work for Amgen, our shareholders,
and the patients we serve. We also believe it is important
that we engage in these activities while remaining
committed to sustainability.
Amgen¡¯s Next-Generation Biomanufacturing facility in
Singapore is an excellent example of the strides we
are making. Once licensed, this site will deploy new
processes and technologies which conserve substantial
amounts of water, curb carbon emissions, reduce the
amount of solid waste generated and operate with a
dramatically smaller footprint than conventional facilities.
In a setting of new technology, we are building upon
our established sustainability practices including green
biology and green chemistry.
Our sustainability achievements would not be possible
without the efforts of staff members who have dedicated
themselves to the company¡¯s targets. Part of our
commitment to all Amgen staff members is the creation
of a work environment that stresses safety and wellness.
Consistent with our commitment, Amgen received a
number of important sustainability acknowledgements in
2014. We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability
World Index for the first time, and we maintained our
position on the North America Index. The U.S. Green
Building Council recognized our building design strategy
by certifying our innovative drug product research
center in Thousand Oaks, California, at the highest
level?LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design) Platinum. The Association of Energy Engineers
recognized Amgen¡¯s energy management strategy with
its top honor, the Corporate Energy Management Award.

We delivered new and existing medicines for patients in more countries than ever before, executing our ambitious plans even as we made transformational changes to make us stronger and more competitive. As Amgen evolves, we remain committed to being a responsible company. We strive to extend the positive impact our medicines make around the world to our work in the communities in which we operate. We commit significant time, energy, and resources to efforts that make us a better global citizen.
Environmental sustainability is one aspect of Amgen¡¯s responsible approach. As a biology-focused company, we have a deep appreciation for the natural environment. We continuously improve operations in a variety of ways to improve our environmental impact. We are making progress toward licensure of our pioneering Next-Generation Biomanufacturing plant in Singapore, which will considerably curb water use, carbon emissions, and the generation of solid waste. In response to drought, we accelerated our already-substantial water conservation efforts at sites in California and Puerto Rico. We have achieved large reductions in carbon emissions from our overall business primarily by making systems more efficient and using less energy. We have evaluated renewable and alternative energy technology options at every major Amgen site and have included renewable and alternative energy projects in our long range plan. 
We are proud to be recognized externally for our sustainability performance. In 2015, Amgen earned placement on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for a second year and was named to the North America Index for a third year. Amgen placed significantly higher in both the US and Global listings in the Newsweek 2015 Green Rankings compared to previous years.
We have launched a Responsibility section on Amgen.com as part of our broader commitment to communicating our non-financial performance.  In addition to this environmental sustainability report, the section contains information on the Amgen Foundation, our Access to Medicine program, corporate giving initiatives, and the health and safety of our staff.

321,Best Buy,3,USA,"Two years into our Renew Blue transformation, I am happy to report that our Company has made considerable progress in improving its performance and that we have an exciting journey ahead of us.  
 
In the fall of 2012, we launched our Renew Blue strategy with the goal of addressing our two problems ? declining comps and declining margins. The strategy was structured around five pillars:  ? Reinvigorate and rejuvenate the customer experience ? Attract and inspire leaders and employees  ? Work with vendor partners to innovate and drive value  ? Increase our return on invested capital for investors  ? Continue our leadership role in positively impacting our world 
 
As the Fifth Pillar reflects, we remained committed to our role in positively impacting the world and the communities in which we work and live even as we transformed Best Buy. Last year, we met our two main sustainability goals ? we collected one billion pounds of electronics and appliances for recycling and reduced our carbon emissions by more than 20 percent. In addition, we launched an additional four Teen Tech Centers, serving underprivileged teens who might not otherwise view technology as a viable career. You will read in this report details about these achievements and other ways that Best Buy has remained a leader in corporate responsibility and sustainability. These successes are, of course, the fruit of the hard work and talent of the more than 125,000 men and women who work at Best Buy. It is an honor to lead this group of amazing individuals and a privilege to work with each and every one of them.  
 
Altogether, we feel that we are at an exciting turning point in our journey. We are moving from a business in turnaround to one in a transformation. As we look ahead, we aspire to build on our position as the leading provider of technology products, services and solutions, as measured by our customers, our employees, our investors and the communities in which we operate. We are excited by our mission to ¡°Ignite Human Potential¡± as we strive to attract and develop great talent and unleash their potential. In addition, we strive to do more than sell products. Instead, we aim to help our customers achieve new possibilities with the help of technology.

We have entered the next phase of our transformation, and our purpose is clear: help customers learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions or take care of what is important to them in their lives. 
 
With this purpose in mind, we are on a mission to constantly innovate to improve the experience of our customers and determined to find ways to accelerate the growth of our business. In this context, we are pursuing the following priorities in fiscal year 2017: 
 
1) Build on our strong industry position and multi-channel capabilities to move the existing business forward 2) Create greater efficiency and reduce waste throughout the business 3) Advance key growth initiatives 
 
2016 is a special year in the history of Best Buy, as it marks our 50th anniversary. From our humble beginnings as a single ¡°Sound of Music¡± store in St. Paul, Minnesota, we have grown to be a specialty retailer that has a strong legacy of innovation. Time and time again, Best Buy has created a way forward.

322,Cameron International,1,USA,"that¡¯s why we decided to extend our internal unifying principle? one cameron?to our approach to sustainability . the goal of one cameron is to foster a culture in which cameron employees are not separated by facility, function or distance, but instead are united in one enterprise with common values and commitments . that foundational principle led us to the theme for this report, ¡°one cameron, one World,¡± which encompasses the many efforts related to sustainability  for our company .
sustainability is not a new concept for cameron . We and our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders have practiced many of the aspects of sustainability for years . safety, one aspect of sustainability, is one of our core values, and an important part of the ¡°moral compass¡± that guides all our decisions and operations . operating with integrity and consideration for all our stakeholders means ¡°sustaining the business,¡± and as such, sustainability is an integral part of the cameron legacy and not an additional or stand-alone activity .because there is no single process that will guarantee adequate energy supplies while fully protecting people and the environment, the energy industry and its suppliers are employing multiple approaches to meet global energy needs . factors that go into the application of global energy alternatives must consider reliability, affordability, waste management, and long-term viability, as well as safe and environmentally friendly considerations for future generations . cameron plays an essential role in these efforts . 
cameron always has taken pride in establishing itself as a responsible corporate citizen?a valuable member  of every community in which we  operate around the world . for example, it is essential to us that we hire  local employees for all our facilities,  from Mexico to Malaysia and singapore to stavenger .
sustaining our financial well-being as well as our social contract obligations extends to compliance with regulatory requirements, industry-accepted practices and cameron¡¯s values in ways that positively impact our employees, business, and the communities with which we interact . 
We refer to this method of doing business as the ¡°cameron Way .¡±  It has guided cameron since our founding in 1920, and it will serve us  well as we journey confidently into  a sustainable future .to be specific, we define sustainability  as making the right business decisions that integrate profitability, ethics, health and safety, stewardship of the environment, employee engagement  and a commitment to the communities in which we operate .We¡¯re proud to say cameron has a  very good story to tell in all these areas, ranging from employees starting a clinic for people living near our facility in Venezuela to constantly improving our energy and emissions reduction products and systems . such efforts benefit cameron and, more importantly, our employees, customers, communities and the environment .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
324,Carnival,1,USA,"Carnival Corporation & plc continues to be the
largest cruise company and among the most
profitable and financially strong leisure travel
companies in the world. Our mission is to take the
world on vacation and deliver exceptional experiences
through many of the world¡¯s best known
cruise brands that cater to a variety of different
geographic regions and lifestyles, all at an outstanding
value unrivaled on land or at sea. We
recognize that our reputation and business viability
are contingent on being transparent and sustainable.
This means providing satisfying vacations
while keeping our guests and crew safe, protecting
the environment, developing our workforce,
strengthening our stakeholder relationships, and
enhancing the port communities that we visit, all
while maintaining our fiscal strength.
The year 2012 also marked the historic 25th
anniversary of Carnival¡¯s initial public offering
(IPO). In 1987, our flagship brand, Carnival Cruise
Lines, first went public and raised $400 million,
which laid the foundation for our future expansion.
Since our IPO, we have grown from a single
North American brand with seven ships to a truly
global cruise company offering a portfolio of 10
brands and 100 ships in fiscal 2012 serving every
segment of the cruise market. Today, we take
great pride in providing rewarding and memorable
vacations to nearly 10 million guests each year.
While our Company has changed over the
years, one area remains constant?our commitment
to serving the community. Our founder, my
father, the late Ted Arison, believed strongly in
the importance of giving back. This philosophy
was ingrained in our Corporate culture early on.
We strive each and every year to make a difference
in our homeports and various regions around
the world in need. We are proud to report that
during the past year Carnival Corporation & plc
gave nearly $10 million to charitable organizations,
including a $2 million donation to support
Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in the U.S.
Looking forward, we remain dedicated to
profitably growing our cruise business and driving
higher returns on capital. We continue to expand
our fleet through a measured pace. Some of these
vessels are expected to replace existing capacity
from the possible sales of older, less-efficient
ships. In 2012, we had nine cruise ships scheduled
for delivery through March 2016. Each of our cruise
lines has a strong, well-established brand position
and continues to attract a growing number of
new and repeat customers. We have strategically
timed the introduction of these new ships to allow
ample time for each brand to grow its passenger
base and absorb the new capacity.
In addition, we are focused on the growth of
emerging cruise regions. During the past five years,
we have doubled our guest sourcing from emerging
markets, a trend we expect will continue in
the future. In 2013, we will capitalize on the
increasing popularity of cruising in Asia with the
deployment of a second Costa ship in China and
the launch of a new Princess program for the
Japanese vacation market. As a result of the initial
success of the Princess launch, Princess has
announced the addition of a second ship to Japan
in 2014. We believe the growing prosperity and
size of the Asian vacation market provides significant
potential for future growth.
We continue to focus on managing costs and
reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint.
We have made significant strides toward reducing
both fuel consumption and the resulting GHG
emissions. In 2013, we expect to reduce fuel consumption
per unit by another five percent. This
will represent a cumulative 21 percent reduction
since 2007. From 2005 to 2012, we reduced our
GHG emission rate by 17 percent. We are nearing
our Corporate target to reduce the intensity
of GHG emissions from shipboard operations by
20 percent by 2015. In addition, our profit improvement
teams are dedicated to reducing other costs
through benchmarking and sharing best practices
among our operating companies, as well as gaining
efficiencies by implementing new technologies.
However, 2012 also was marked by a major
unforeseen challenge with the grounding of the
Costa Concordia, operated by Costa Cruises. This
incident had a profound impact on each and every
employee of the Company, both shipboard and
shoreside. The entire Carnival Corporation & plc
family extends its deepest sympathies to the families
and loved ones of those who lost their lives.
We have dedicated the full resources of the
Company to understand what went wrong and to
find solutions to avoid a similar occurrence in the
future. Our commitment to the safety and security
of our guests and crew has always been and
remains our first priority. Since the incident,
we have taken steps to identify lessons learned
and best practices.
Specifically, we immediately launched a
comprehensive audit and review of safety and
emergency response. This wide-ranging review
included consultation with outside experts in
several key safety areas to ensure that we understand
what went wrong and prevent it from happening
again. Some of the actions we are taking
as a result of this review are summarized elsewhere
in this report.
Subsequently, we actively participated in a
leadership role in the Cruise Industry Operational
Safety Review that the Cruise Lines International
Association and the European Cruise Council
launched on behalf of the global cruise industry. This review encompassed careful examination
of existing safety procedures to identify industry
best practices and develop new policies for bridge
procedure harmonization and bridge access, passenger
muster and emergency instructions, and
passage planning and approvals. As a result of the
review, regulatory changes were proposed to the
International Maritime Organization (IMO) that
will benefit the entire industry. In addition, Costa
Cruises and Carnival Corporation & plc worked
closely with the Italian authorities on the salvage
plan with the contract.
Since its inception, the priorities of the salvage
project have included respect for the environment,
workplace safety and protection of the Giglio
Island socio-economic life. The ship is located in
the Tuscan Archipelago National Park and the
Pelagos Sanctuary. The Tuscan regional environmental
protection agency began monitoring water
conditions around the ship immediately after the
incident and will continue until the ship has been
removed. No significant pollution levels have been
recorded so far. The fuel contained in Concordia¡¯s
fuel tanks, which could have been a significant
environmental risk if released, was successfully
removed on March 24th, 2012. Approximately
2,100 tons of oil from 17 tanks was removed.
Taking care of the sea bottom will be a priority
throughout all activities to remove Concordia.
Once removal is complete, the sea bottom will be
cleaned and marine flora replanted. A map of the
seabed was prepared on a joint basis with the
Universit? La Sapienza in Rome and the salvage
team, to protect priority habitats in the area,
including native seagrass meadows and coral
formations. About 200 specimens of pinna nobilis
or ¡°fan mussels¡± (a species of large saltwater
clams) found near the wreck have been catalogued
and transferred to another area, awaiting
relocation to their original home when work is
complete. The fish population was also studied
and experts took a census of marine mammals in
the area.
The removal of Concordia is a unique and
extremely complex technical-engineering operation,
considered the biggest salvage ever attempted
on a ship of its size?with the deployment of the
finest international expertise, state-of-the-art
technology and unprecedented financial resources.
Activity at the site continued non-stop throughout
2012 with about 500 salvage operators working
round the clock. Due to the complexity of the project,
along with weather and sea conditions, the
latest timelines based on the progress of work
on the project thus far envisage that the salvage
operation will be completed by the summer of 2014.
A dedicated website (www.theparbucklingproject.
com) was developed by Costa Cruises and the
salvage group describing all aspects of the project.
This includes environmental protection and
monitoring, community engagement and updated
salvage developments.
We are confident that the combination of
these comprehensive initiatives provides us
with the tools to further enhance the policies and
practices that ensure the safety and security of
our guests and crew. The global cruise industry
remains one of the world¡¯s safest travel options.
We reiterate our deep and continuing commitment
to protecting the health, safety and security of
our guests, employees and all others working on
behalf of the Company, and the environment.
In closing, we would also like to thank the
90,000 shipboard and shoreside employees of
Carnival Corporation & plc and our Board of
Directors for their hard work and perseverance
during the past year. Carnival Corporation & plc
continues to be a very strong company. This past
year is a testament to our ability to weather a
challenging period through the outstanding leadership
of our global management teams, the foresight
and vision of our Board, and the spirit of
teamwork shared by our employees worldwide.
Our long-term fundamentals remain strong and
our brands continue to provide truly exceptional
vacation experiences at an outstanding value to
millions of satisfied consumers around the globe.
We invite you to read our latest Sustainability
Report and welcome your comments.

325,Carnival,2,USA,"I¡¯m pleased to update you on some of the exciting things happening throughout Carnival Corporation & plc.  We are a proud family of ten world¡¯s leading cruise brands. Across our brands and 100 ships we have the opportunity to cater to any desire.  
The most satisfying part of my job is knowing that the work we do every day is helping people build lifelong memories. People are truly passionate when it comes to their vacation and all of us at Carnival make sure that the more than  10.6 million people who choose to entrust their vacation with us have an amazing time. We constantly strive not only to meet our guest¡¯s expectations every time, but to exceed them. That¡¯s pretty special!
We also recognize that our reputation and success depend on sustainable and transparent operations. We maintain this commitment by keeping our guests and crewmembers safe, protecting the environment, developing our workforce, strengthening our stakeholder relations, enhancing the port communities that our ships visit as well as the communities where we work, and maintaining our financial strength. These are vital to our success as a business and reflective of our core values. 
We strive to be a company that people want to work for and to be a responsible global corporate citizen. In addition to our financial performance, we continue to make progress on many fronts in our sustainability efforts and I would like to share with you our most recent sustainability achievements.
2020 SUSTAINABILITY GOALS In 2014, we expanded our corporate goals beyond our carbon (CO2e) reduction goal and developed ten new sustainability goals. The goals are focused on reducing our environmental footprint by 2020, while enhancing the health, safety and security of our guests and crewmembers, and ensuring sustainable business practices across our brands and business partners.
OUR PRODUCT New product initiatives and innovative marketing campaigns across our brands over the past year are driving increased demand. We experienced a sustained improvement in booking trends throughout 2014 and furthered our pursuit of capturing insights from our guests with a comprehensive segmentation study in North America. This was the first time we have done this across our brands and the largest segmentation study ever done in our industry. We continued our efforts in early 2015, which marked the first time ever in the history of the company that we executed a multi-brand marketing campaign, primarily targeted at our North American guests, to generate more conversations about cruising. 
FATHOM ? IMPACT + TRAVEL As part of our new product innovation, our new brand Fathom is pioneering a new travel category called impact travel, which is built around mindful, purpose-driven activities and programs that enable guests to make a real sustainable impact in the communities we journey to. 
In 2016, Fathom will make its maiden voyages to two vibrant Caribbean destinations - Cuba and the Dominican Republic - each with different cultures and each with different objectives, but both with common dreams for the well-being of their people. BUSINESS PARTNER CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS In 2014, we released our Business Partner Code of Conduct and Ethics. This code goes a step above and beyond our Business Code of Conduct and Ethics by helping our business partners within our supply chain more fully understand and comply with our expectations for legal compliance and ethical behavior. Building and maintaining trust in our business relationships and pursuing the highest standards of ethical behavior are fundamental aspects of our Company¡¯s core values. 
TECHNOLOGY AND EMISSIONS REDUCTION Developing and implementing technological advances are an important component of our sustainability strategy. We continue to drive innovation and technological breakthroughs within the cruise and maritime industry.  We have taken the lead on developing technology to mitigate the impact of new low-sulfur fuel usage requirements. In 2013, we began installing new exhaust gas cleaning technologies on our ships and this year we significantly expanded the installation program.
We are also pioneering a new era in the use of low carbon fuels, by using Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) on our four next-generation cruise ships for our Costa Cruises and AIDA Cruises brands. These new ships, once completed, will use LNG to generate 100 percent of the ship¡¯s power both in port and on the open sea ? an innovation that will significantly reduce exhaust emissions to help protect the environment.
HUMAN CAPITAL Our diversity and inclusion values are reflected throughout our organization in our people, our brands, our ports of call, and our customers. Diversity is a business imperative. We began 2014 with the first ever global leadership team meeting that brought together our top 65 leaders from around the world and achieved remarkable alignment on our vision and top priorities and we have plans to extend this outreach even further within our organization. We also remain focused on hiring and retaining the best and brightest as well as promoting within our organization.
NEW SHIPS New ships are an important component of our sustainability strategy. Our new ships significantly outperform the fleet average on fuel consumption rate, ship operating cost and cabin balcony percentage, all resulting in a higher return  on investment. In 2014, we introduced Princess Cruises¡¯  Regal Princess. Her naming ceremony included a celebration with the crew of the well-known Love Boat television series, who served as the ship¡¯s Godparents! In 2014, we also introduced Costa Cruises¡¯ Costa Diadema, the line¡¯s largest ever ship. In early 2015, we welcomed the newest addition to the P&O fleet, Britannia, who was named by her Godmother, Her Majesty the Queen of England.
Our plans for the future include eighteen ships scheduled to be delivered between 2016 and 2022. 
PARTNERSHIPS ? THE NATURE CONSERVANCY We partner with a variety of organizations around the world and consider these select partnerships to be critical to our long-term success. In 2014, we contributed to the support of The Nature Conservancy¡¯s global marine protection priorities with a $2.5 million gift over an initial five year period.
The Nature Conservancy is one of the world¡¯s leading conservation organizations. Our support will significantly scale up their coral reefs restoration initiatives and Mapping Ocean Wealth program, and will continue to advance important scientific developments for marine conservation.
NEW MARKETS Asia, and in particular, China continues to be a focus for our emerging market development efforts. We were the first to enter the Chinese market through our Costa Cruises brand in 2006 and we are currently the largest cruise operator in mainland China. In 2014, we bolstered our lead in the industry with four ships home ported out of mainland China and have announced plans to add two additional ships in 2016 and two additional ships in 2017. To coordinate our growth strategy, our Chief Operations Officer, Alan Buckelew, relocated to China and we have also entered into several strategic agreements focused on expanding the cruise industry in China.
We had many successes in 2014, but perhaps the most important accomplishment was delivering memorable vacation experiences to a record 10.6 million plus guests.
In our business, it is all about the people. One out of every two guests who cruise anywhere in the world cruise with us. This is only possible because of the extraordinary efforts of our employees worldwide who passionately and consistently deliver joyful and memorable vacation experiences for our guests, as well as our travel agent partners around the globe who support our brands. I thank them all.
I believe it is critical that our employees continue to be proud of their company and feel confident about its future. To succeed we must continue to consistently exceed guest expectations on every single one of our cruises. If we do that, we will continue to increase earnings and our return on invested capital and have funds to reinvest in our business and sustainability efforts. We are making very good progress in this area and I am honored and excited to be part of  this advancement. 
I would like to extend my sincerest appreciation to our employees, stakeholders and of course, our more than  10.6 million valued guests for choosing to spend their vacation with us. I look forward to welcoming you aboard soon and I invite you to read more about our sustainability journey in this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

575,Carnival,4,USA,"2015 was a great year for our company, one of the strongest in our 43-year history on a number of fronts. The credit goes to the dedication, talent and passion of our employees, who with vital support of our many business partners, make it their mission to deliver joyful vacation experiences to the nearly 11 million guests who sail with our 10 global cruise brands.  
Equally important, we made meaningful progress on our sustainability goals and key areas  of focus as evident on pages 12-13  of this report.
Our ability to sustain continuing improvement is the result of many factors. First and foremost, we are committed to exceeding our guest¡¯s expectations. We have a deep commitment to operating safely and responsibly, as our very existence is tied to providing a safe and comfortable environment for our guests and crew members and in protecting the oceans, seas and ports-of-call in which we operate. The exceptional teamwork among our ship and shoreside teams and our focus on innovation and continuous improvement creates a strong foundation for furthering our growth year over year. 
 
I¡¯m excited to share highlights of  our 2015 sustainability achievements from ship to shore and preview some of our future plans as part of our ¡°Cruising. Commitment. Community.¡± efforts. CRUISING BRAND HIGHLIGHTS Throughout 2015, we had a number of opportunities to showcase our brands globally and increase awareness and consideration for cruising as a great vacation value. 
P&O Cruises UK delivered Britannia , the largest ship ever built specifically for British guests, which was named by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Princess Cruises¡¯ 50th anniversary celebration reunited the original cast of the U.S. television series ¡°The Love Boat.¡± Cunard Line¡¯s 175th anniversary salute to Liverpool saw its ¡°three Queens¡± ships ? Queen
 Elizabeth, Queen Victoria and Queen Mary 2 ?  captivate 1.3 million spectators in what may have been the largest attendance at a single-day maritime event in history. Our five-ship gathering in Sydney Harbor was a rare event that garnered P&O Cruises Australia over three hours of live coverage on Australia¡¯s ¡°Today Show.¡± 
Continuing our sustainability journey, we introduced our 10th and newest brand, Fathom, which is pioneering a new travel category, social impact travel, which combines people¡¯s love for travel with the desire to make  a difference in the world. 
CRUISING TO CUBA In 2015, we received U.S. approval to sail to Cuba, and on May 1, 2016, Carnival Corporation made history as our Fathom brand became the first American cruise company to sail from the U.S. to Cuba in many decades. This also marked the first time in many years that Cuban-born individuals were able to sail to and from Cuba - this is a direct result of collaborative talks between our dedicated team and Cuba. Fathom¡¯s Adonia now takes guests from Miami to Cuba every other week. COMMITMENT NEW SHIPS We remain focused on maintaining measured capacity growth by delivering innovative, more efficient ships for our fleet. We continued to make progress on our fleet 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT & CEO 
SUSTAINABILITY FROM SHIP TO SHORE 7
enhancement program as we finalized agreements for 15 new ships for delivery between 2016 and 2020. Four of these next-generation ships will pioneer a new era in the use of cleaner fuels as the first cruise ships to be powered by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) both at sea and in port. 
LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) VISION We are committed to reducing our air emissions and improving air quality by evaluating new and established technology solutions. LNG is one of the solutions we are working to implement across our fleet both in port and at sea due to its reduced carbon profile and cleaner emissions. The environmental benefits of LNG, in combination with regulatory and supply chain factors, were a tipping point for us to begin the transition to build the world¡¯s first LNG-powered cruise ships.
The first step to realizing our vision was by using LNG in port. In 2015 in Hamburg, Germany, AIDAsol was the first cruise ship in the world to be supplied with power by an LNG hybrid barge. In 2016, our AIDA Cruises brand launched AIDAprima , with dual-fuel powered engines, she is the first cruise ship in the world to use LNG while in port. By the end of 2018, we will be the first cruise company to use LNG to power our ships when they are both in port and on the open sea. 
CARNIVAL MARITIME CENTER (CMC) In 2015, we opened the doors of the CMC in Hamburg, Germany, where we invested in the most advanced technologies available to create a Marine Operations Unit that assists our captains, chief engineers, and deck and engineering officers with digital support, control and planning of all technical and nautical operations, supporting two of our brands (AIDA Cruises and Costa Cruises), with 
similar plans in the works at various stages in the rest of our fleet. One of the main features of the CMC is the Fleet Operations Center, which is managed 24 hours a day, allowing for improved communications between the ship and shore, and providing immediate support to our ships for route planning, maritime safety and risk management. COMMUNITY AMBER COVE We are thrilled about our newest port and Caribbean destination, Amber Cove, located in the Dominican Republic. The construction of the cruise port at Amber Cove has been an incredible project for our corporation, the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean region as a whole. This represents our single largest direct port development project with an $85 million investment to date, the largest cruise industry investment ever made in the Dominican Republic. As part of our commitment to the Dominican Republic, we are excited that in April 2016, our Fathom brand started to make trips every other week to the region, enriching the lives of its travelers as they work alongside the locals and assist them with their community needs.
DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA We reinforced our leadership position in the China cruise region with the successful introduction of a fourth ship in 2015 ? Costa Serena . We are well positioned in 2016 with two more year-round ships ? one each for Costa Cruises and Princess Cruises ? making us the first cruise company with six ships based in China, maintaining our leading cruise presence with nearly half of the overall market share in  the country.
Sustaining growth beyond 2016, Princess Cruises¡¯ Majestic Princess , 
the first ship built specifically for Chinese guests and designed to stimulate consumer demand. We plan to introduce two additional brands in China in 2017 and 2018 when AIDA Cruises and Carnival Cruise Line join our growing presence in the region. Entering China with multiple brands enables us to accelerate our growth and achieve deeper penetration by providing products aimed at different market segments.
Also in 2015, Carnival Corporation & plc formed a strategic joint venture by partnering with state owned China State Shipbuilding Company and China Investment Corporation to launch a new cruise brand in the Chinese vacation region. AS OUR JOURNEY CONTINUES As a responsible corporate citizen, sustainable growth is one of our core values. In September 2015, we announced our 2020 Sustainability Goals reinforcing our commitment to the environment, our guests, our employees and the communities in which we operate. We established 10 goals aimed at reducing our environmental footprint while enhancing the health, safety and security of our guests and crew members, and ensuring sustainable business practices across our brands and business partners.

uring the past 23 years, Chesapeake Energy Corporation
has grown from a start-up company to the nation¡¯s
second-largest producer of natural gas, the 11th largest
producer of natural gas liquids and oil, and the most
active driller of new wells in the United States by using an innovative
approach to resource identification and development.
Chesapeake has captured America¡¯s largest natural gas and
liquids resource base through advances in geoscientific understanding
of unconventional reservoirs, investments in horizontal
drilling technology improvements and the building of a unique
large-scale leasehold acquisition program.
¡°Leading a Responsible Energy Future¡± is our first corporate
responsibility report and puts our success as an explorer and
producer of U.S. resources in the context of our performance in
economic, environmental and community leadership. We know
to be successful we must:
? Use safe and environmentally responsible practices
in the production of natural gas, natural gas
liquids and oil
? Create economic growth in the communities
where we operate while also providing education,
philanthropy and volunteer support
? Help rejuvenate America¡¯s manufacturing base
and reduce America¡¯s dependence on foreign
oil by advancing the use of clean and affordable
American natural gas
? Support the well-being of our employees and their
families, and continue building a culture that has
earned us a spot on FORTUNE¡¯s 100 Best Companies
to Work For¢ç list for six consecutive years
? Provide an open and constructive dialogue with
stakeholders about our operations and practices
While the report details our efforts in 2011, we also have
included notable activities from 2012. These include changes to
our approach to corporate governance and the reconstitution of
our Board of Directors. These constructive changes were made
with shareholder input and align with Chesapeake¡¯s promise to
consistently improve our operations and continually create value
for all of our stakeholders.
I am proud of our employees and their ongoing efforts to
responsibly produce America¡¯s own natural gas, natural gas
liquids and oil. We have helped lead our industry¡¯s revolution in
unconventional resource identification and development, and I
am confident in the years ahead we will continue to deliver on
the commitments we have made to our stakeholders and help
lead our nation to an independent energy future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
328,Chesapeake Energy,2,USA,"One of my main priorities for Chesapeake is to ensure that corporate responsibility underpins the work we do every
day. Integrity, trust, respect, transparency and stewardship of corporate resources and the environment are essential
to the success of any business, and I will ensure these values are embedded in Chesapeake¡¯s culture.
As a company, we are focused on delivering shareholder value through financial discipline and profitable and efficient
growth from captured resources, including balancing capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, reducing operational
risk and complexity, promoting a culture of safety and integrity, and being a great place to work. This report emphasizes
our relentless pursuit of meeting and exceeding these objectives.
Our focus on the safe and environmentally responsible production of oil and natural gas is propelling our country toward
greater energy security, creating well-paying jobs and catalyzing economic growth in communities where we operate. While
we further moved toward the production of liquids in 2012 as part of our business strategy, we remain unwavering in our
long-term commitment to natural gas and the benefits it delivers through security and emissions reductions.
Over the last year, we focused our business on returns on capital investment while also continuing our support for employee
and community development. We were included on FORTUNE magazine¡¯s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For¢çfor
the sixth straight year. We also showed a strong commitment to the United Way across all of our operating areas through
employee and company donations and volunteer efforts. In 2012, some of our key governance changes and operational
accomplishments were:
? Strengthening Board of Directors oversight of our environmental, health
and safety efforts by ensuring that an update on our performance is
among the first agenda items of every regular Board meeting.
? Linking a portion of every executive¡¯s annual incentive compensation to
performance against certain safety metrics.
? Decreasing our oilfield services companies¡¯ recordable incident rate
37% in 2012, which can be attributed to increased hazard identification
programs and the promotion of heat-related illness prevention.
? Making strides toward more efficient and responsible operations, specifically
in regards to water usage during drilling and hydraulic fracturing
operations ? reducing our water use 16% from 2011 to 2012. In the years ahead, we will continue to be an economic catalyst and a responsible neighbor
in the communities where we operate. We will remain focused on addressing the social
and environmental considerations that surround our operations by developing innovative
solutions and refining best practices that can be standardized across our operations. We
will also continue to support the health, safety and well-being of our employees and foster a
culture that inspires excellence and integrity.
I am proud to lead this company and work closely with our talented employees to achieve
a responsible energy future.

329,Chevron,1,USA,"For more than 135 years, Chevron has been focused on
the same goal ? safely developing the affordable energy vital
to economic growth and development.
Fulfilling our goal involves managing the risks inherent in our
industry. We work tirelessly to mitigate those risks, even as
the scale and complexity of our projects continue to increase.
Fulfilling our goal also involves a commitment to responsible
and ethical behavior, which is embedded in our system of
values. And Chevron¡¯s 58,000 employees around the world are
committed to those values, which we call The Chevron Way.
The expectations of our stockholders, our partners and
communities have never been higher. They expect that we will
live up to these values and that we will achieve our results
the right way. Every single employee, including me, has the
same expectations.
Fundamental to everything we do is a constant focus on achieving
higher levels of operational, environmental and safety
performance. We continue to be an industry leader in personal
safety, as measured by injuries requiring time away from
work. And in 2012, we delivered our lowest spill volumes ever.
We are proud of our progress, but we are not at zero. We understand
that the stakes are high and the tolerance is low for
events that affect people and the environment. We are working
to eliminate incidents. This report shares our progress toward world-class performance
in Operational Excellence, highlighting how we build a
consistent safety culture, manage deepwater risk, eliminate
flares, protect biodiversity in our global operations and
improve the livelihoods of communities near our operations.
These efforts are guided by our Operational Excellence
Management System, which aligns with international standards
for safety and environmental performance and drives
extensive use of tools ? such as stop-work authority, by which
every employee and contractor has the right and responsibility
to stop work when noticing an unsafe act or condition; our
Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment, which is
used before we begin and throughout the life cycle of our major
capital projects; and active engagement with our stakeholders.
Managing risk and executing with excellence are critical
to our company¡¯s success. Equally critical are the stability and
vitality of the countries and communities where we operate.
Chevron operates in some of the most challenging, complex
and dynamic places in the world. In many locations, communities
must confront critical social and economic issues, including
access to health care, education and the resources needed
for sustained prosperity.
We partner with local governments, our business partners and
our stakeholders to enhance communities by generating
jobs, supporting local supply chains and strengthening local
economies. We also expand health and education capacity, support small businesses, train workers to industry
standards, and invest in the local workforce. For example, in
Angola, Kazakhstan and Nigeria more than 85 percent of
our employees are nationals.
In 2012, we purchased more than $60 billion in goods and
services around the globe, providing a meaningful stimulus for
local economies. And in the past seven years, we¡¯ve invested
nearly $1.2 billion in partnerships worldwide to build stronger,
healthier communities. Our approach to partnership is
showcased in this year¡¯s report ? in how we are partnering
with local government and other stakeholders to help develop
the economic future of the Onslow community in Western
Australia, and how we partner with governments, communities
and health organizations in the fight against HIV/AIDS in
sub-Saharan Africa.
We¡¯re proud of the work we do, and we¡¯re always striving
to be better. By being vigilant in maintaining a strong, healthy
workforce; operating safely and responsibly; partnering to
create value for our stakeholders; and providing energy the
right way ? The Chevron Way ? we help meet the world¡¯s
energy needs and continue to foster economic development
around the world. We hope you find the case studies and
operational data in this report to be informative and useful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
330,Cisco Systems,1,USA,"In today¡¯s world, the only constant is change ? and companies and countries that do not change are left behind. My perspective on change is to embrace it, lead it, and use it to shape desired outcomes. 
We work closely with our customers and partners to anticipate change and transitions, to understand where the market is going, and to innovate to solve their toughest business challenges. This approach requires a vision, strategy, and solutions that address challenges while benefiting society and the environment. This is the course Cisco has followed since our formation, and it¡¯s all made possible through networks.
Networking technology connects people in meaningful ways and has the power to create new opportunities, deliver richer experiences, and boost economic growth and wellbeing. At Cisco, one way we see that happening is through what we call the ¡°Internet of Everything (IoE).¡± In simple terms, IoE is the intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things on the network. IoE offers countries and governments around the world the opportunity to provide better, richer lives for their citizens and create new ways for companies to do business. Whether it¡¯s connected education and healthcare, smarter cities, more efficient government services, or increased job creation, we believe the societal benefits of IoE will impact our lives in ways never imagined. It¡¯s not the act of getting connected ? or even the number of connections ? that creates the value; rather, it¡¯s the outcomes the connections make possible. The speed of change today is unprecedented, and it is critical that companies and countries capitalize on the vast opportunities that the IoE offers.
With companies, individuals, and governments working together, we can help economies all over the world develop and grow equitably. Governments alone cannot solve the global challenges we face today; only through bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders can we tackle inequities in education and employment. Our role in the White House IT Training and Certification pilot, which helps transitioning U.S. military personnel with IT skills training, certification, and career placement, highlights the power of public-private partnerships in creating positive impact. 
Our focus on creating value for society, the  environment, and our business is reflected in the  breadth of our commitments: from investing in our employees to improving labor standards in our supply chain, and from improving access to healthcare to reducing our environmental footprint. These are all 
multiyear efforts that require a long-term view to  achieve positive outcomes. In FY13, as an example,  we introduced new five-year environmental goals designed to focus on the issues we believe are most critical to Cisco¡¯s environmental sustainability over the long-term ? greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. CSR has always been one of the pillars  of our culture, and I¡¯m extremely proud of the global impact of our programs. 
Given all that we have been able to achieve not only for our customers and partners, but for society and the environment, I am energized by the opportunity ahead as we work to become the number-one IT company. Ultimately, the success and impact of the Internet of Everything will be measured by the extent to which we¡¯re able to harness its benefits for humanity. With this in mind, we couldn¡¯t be more excited to see what the future holds. We are deeply committed to improving lives, communities, and the environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

332,Cisco Systems,3,USA,"In today¡¯s world, technology is enabling us to create incredible value at a pace faster than we have ever seen. As we connect people, machines, and devices around the world, we create enormous opportunity while changing lives. 
I am proud to introduce Cisco¡¯s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report, which shows in so many ways how our focus on combining human and technological innovation is helping people and our planet.
As an example, over the last 18 years, our Cisco Networking Academy¢ç program has helped more than 5.5 million students at 9500 learning institutions in 170 countries develop the skills to thrive in the digital economy. Our four-year investment in the Jordan Healthcare Initiative has benefited 150,000 patients through a series of projects that use collaboration and communication technologies to transform how healthcare is delivered. 
In FY15, we also made solid progress on our environmental goals. We increased energy efficiency and renewable energy through our EnergyOps Program, and we broadened the scope of our goals to include our supply chain. 
None of this would be possible without the dedication of our amazing people, who make all of this happen. We¡¯ve challenged and empowered all of our employees to ¡°connect everything, innovate everywhere, and benefit everyone,¡± and we are investing in the tools, skills, and resources to support them in that effort. Cisco¡¯s new Executive Leadership Team is also more diverse in gender, ethnicity, age, and work experience than ever before, and one of the most diverse in the industry. 
I truly believe that what is good for the world and good for business are more closely connected than ever before. As more and more people and things come online and become connected, we have more opportunity than ever to change the world. Our leadership role as a corporate citizen and steward is core to all that we do, and will be a key driver of our long-term success. 
I look forward to continuing this important work in the years ahead. In our digitized world, astonishing opportunities emerge when people connect. By 2020, there is the potential to connect 50 billion people, processes, data, and things through the Internet. When you consider the magnitude of that number, you can see how powerful digitization can  be as we work to solve some of the world¡¯s most pressing problems.
Our vision is to empower people and societies to thrive in this new digitized economy to create exponential social, environmental, and business impact. 
As our CEO Chuck Robbins noted in his message, CSR is core to Cisco¡¯s long-term success. Our strategy focuses on 4 primary areas: 1. Help advance positive social change through technology-based solutions and multi-stakeholder partnerships that support access to critical human needs, education, healthcare, and economic empowerment. 2. Address the challenges around the growing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills gap and global unemployment?especially youth unemployment?by empowering a new generation of global problem solvers who ¡°innovate like technologists, think like entrepreneurs, and become social change agents¡±. 3. Ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of the environment by addressing energy consumption from our operations, supply chain, and products, while helping our customers address their own environmental sustainability challenges. 4. Invest in the future to create conditions for sustainable economic growth, earn the ongoing trust of our stakeholders, and promote ethical conduct and human rights in everything we do.
I am delighted that each section of the CSR report this year is introduced by executive leaders from the responsible business functions, reflecting alignment of CSR strategy with core business strategy. We will continue to drive this integration and further sharpen our focus on the most material CSR issues with our new Executive Leadership Team. 
In 2015, Cisco was honored to be named to Fortune magazine¡¯s firstever ¡°Change the World¡± list, which recognizes companies that have made significant progress in addressing major social problems as a part of their core business strategy. This CSR report shares some of the stories about how technology has benefitted humanity.
In the end, the digitization era is bigger than Cisco?or any company, for that matter. It will require unprecedented cooperation between many companies, organizations, and governments. Together, I am hopeful we can make a difference in people¡¯s lives, communities, and the planet.

577,Cisco Systems,4,USA,"Welcome to Cisco¡¯s FY16 CSR report, which covers my first full year as CEO of Cisco?a year in which I believe our CSR programs have strengthened more than ever. This year we committed to positively impact the lives of one billion people by 2025. This is an ambitious goal, but one I truly believe that we can achieve.
One of the ways in which we have sought to make a difference is through our work with cities. In October 2015, I had the pleasure of attending the launch of Cisco¡¯s first ¡°Lighthouse City¡± in Washington, DC. As this effort comes to life over the next few years, it will illustrate how transformative our technology can be in the lives of so many. The smart city infrastructure we¡¯re building there?from smart streetlights to water monitors?will make sustainable lifestyles more achievable for thousands of people. We¡¯re also making additional investments in our Cisco Networking Academy¢ç program in the city to enable more people to get trained in the skills needed to participate in the digital economy. Our work in Washington, DC is just one example of the problem-solving power that makes Cisco unique. With the momentum we have built over the last several years, we now have the opportunity to empower even more people to confront the big global issues that face all of us, and develop solutions that have the potential to scale, replicate, and be sustainable. To do that requires a commitment to education and economic empowerment?two things I am deeply passionate about. In FY16, and in the years ahead, we are committed to delivering more digital skills training and investing in innovative, early stage nonprofit solutions that use technology to address social and environmental challenges. Living Goods is another example of our commitment to improving lives, and shows what¡¯s possible when technology and social impact come together. This nonprofit social enterprise empowers health entrepreneurs in Kenya and Uganda to deliver life-saving products to the doorsteps of the poor. With Cisco funding, they developed a mobile technology platform to support their business and grow from 400 to 4000 community health workers over the past 4 years. These health workers now serve 3 million clients, and the program has driven huge social benefits, lowering child mortality by 25 percent at an annual cost of less than $2 per person while creating livelihoods for thousands of women. While we are committed to making a difference in the lives of people around the world, we are also committed to improving what we do at Cisco. For instance, we continue to make our own operations more sustainable. Starting in FY14 and by the end of our 4-year program in FY17, we will have implemented over 450 energy efficiency and renewable energy projects?100 this past year alone?with a net present value of $69 million over 10 years. When these projects are complete, they will collectively avoid 140 GWh of energy each year. We are also piloting an Internet-of-Things (IoT) factory of the future with a manufacturing partner, using thousands of sensors to measure the energy consumption of systems and equipment as part of a range of initiatives to reduce the footprint of our extended operations.Our customers are facing many challenges of their own, and we are partnering with them on our energy management solutions, remote collaboration solutions, teleworking and mobility, and cloud services that help them solve business, environmental, and social problems. Our circular economy program is working to increase used product returns for resale or recycling; study leasing and as-a-service models to facilitate return and reuse; implement IoT technologies for improved asset tracking, maintenance, and operations; and improve product and packaging design. All that we are doing is only possible due to the dedication of our incredible team at Cisco, and I am thankful for their efforts. I am also proud that we now have a higher level of diversity in our senior leadership team than ever before, which reinforces our commitment to promoting a more diverse workforce. We continue to work hard toward attracting more diverse talent into our workforce, and our leading metrics on hiring are showing good progress. In the pages ahead, you¡¯ll be able to dig in to all the details on our CSR work over the past year?work that is core to who we are. As you read through this report, I hope you¡¯ll see that Cisco¡¯s social and environmental programs address fundamental issues that are important to people all over the world. As we do this work, we¡¯re also holding ourselves accountable by continuing to support and report our progress toward the universal principles embodied in the United Nations Global Compact. I truly believe that we are at our best when we combine our business strength with our desire to do good in the world. As we see more and more people and things connect in the years ahead, we will have even more opportunities to change the world for good, and I can¡¯t wait to see what we will accomplish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More and more  goods and services are exchanged with the swipe of a finger.  We¡¯re working to spread the benefits of digitization beyond the affluent consumer. In Mexico, for example, Citi and Banamex (our Mexican subsidiary) partnered with the largest mobile network operator in Latin America to introduce mobile wallets targeted to reach 50 million unbanked and underbanked people.
All of our work, which you can read about in more detail in  this report, is underpinned by our dedicated employees. Our diverse and talented global workforce is able to provide a  wide range of ideas and solutions to clients. They are vital  to the success of our business, of our customers and of the communities we serve.  And they¡¯re the foundation of every accomplishment detailed in this report.
As one of the world¡¯s largest and most geographically diverse companies, Citi has special responsibilities. We take pride in the various ways that our focused citizenship efforts are integrated into our business operations.
For instance, we help our clients harness the many benefits  of globalization?especially by connecting them to the growth opportunities in the emerging markets. At the same time, we¡¯re also increasing our commitment to financial inclusion  in developing areas. And through our partnership with the  U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, we have provided 38 microfinance institutions in 21 countries with access to capital to fund small loans to nearly one million unbanked or under-banked borrowers.
With globalization comes urbanization?which offers great opportunities for growth but also puts potential strain on our infrastructure and natural resources. Thus, as Citi continues  to emphasize the world¡¯s top cities, our firm is committed to efficient and sustainable growth. In 2012, we expanded our Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED¢ç) certified portfolio to more than 200 projects, the first bank  to pass that milestone, which contributed to significant  reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions, water use  and waste from operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a global leader in financial services, we at Citi have matched our passion to meet the world¡¯s toughest challenges with support for clients on their road from ambition to achievement. As globalization, urbanization, and digitization reshape society, financial services that enable progress for individuals, families, and communities have never been more important.
In this time of rapid change, corporate citizenship remains tightly linked to our business strategy. We focus our citizenship efforts on the three areas where we can achieve the greatest impact: promoting financial inclusion and economic empowerment, advancing environmental sustainability, and valuing our people.  And we¡¯re pleased that others are noticing.

As part of a partnership with the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation begun in 2007, Citi and OPIC have invested $365 million to fund 40 microfinance institutions in 22 countries, reaching more than 975,000 borrowers.
 ? For our commitment to the global  green economy, we surpassed?three years early?our 10-year goal to invest $50 billion in activities that mitigate climate change.
 ? And with respect to our ongoing commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce, we supported 92 employee networks?up from 74 in 2012?with roughly 14,000 members across 35 global locations.
But we also faced a number of challenges, including the recent discovery of ethical failures that have jeopardized our credibility, the currency that allows us to meet our goals. In 2014, we are launching a comprehensive program?one that includes improved training and a continued focus on responsible finance?to support and enhance the institutional values that have served this company so well for more than 200 years.This report outlines many additional challenges and how we continue to dialogue with our various stakeholders to work toward resolutions. For instance, our participation in the United Nations Global Compact reinforces our commitment to being a good corporate citizen by binding signatories from around the world to the same principles of responsibility.
All of our achievements would not be possible without the dedication of our employees?nearly 250,000 across 160 countries. Our global workforce provides creative and innovative ideas and solutions to clients to enable progress. Our people have embraced our corporate citizenship efforts and we could not succeed without their tireless commitment. Together, we will harness the power of our global network in support of the customers, clients, and communities we serve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
335,Citigroup,3,USA,"How does Citizenship work connect to
Citi¡¯s business?
Citi¡¯s mission is to enable progress. Through our
core business practices and philanthropic work, we
are privileged to serve people in more than 100
countries and jurisdictions, as provider, partner,
employer and neighbor.
Our citizenship approach has three key elements:
Invest, Partner and Act. We work with companies,
governments and institutions of all shapes, sizes,
scale and scope to lend, facilitate and invest in
products and services that power the global
economy.
We recognize that we don¡¯t have all the answers
and that collaboration is essential. We partner
with a variety of companies, nonprofits, NGOs and
governments to drive innovation, expand access
to financial education and opportunity, support
urban growth and inclusive communities and
foster economic growth.
We understand that without trust, we cannot
succeed. We strive to act with integrity and to
meet and exceed our responsibilities in all that we
do. When we don¡¯t, we hold ourselves accountable.
Why is Citi focused on its Citizenship efforts
during a time of challenge for the industry and
transition within the company?
2014 was an important chapter in our story of
transformation across the firm. By any measure
Citi has become simpler, smaller, safer and
stronger since the financial crisis. We have
returned to our roots and are focused on providing
banking services to consumers and institutions
with an emphasis on reliable execution and
strong ethics. Given the pace and scale of global
challenges and opportunities, from providing
access to basic banking services for the two billion
people who lack it, to training the workforce of
tomorrow, Citi has a unique capacity to support
economic progress in the communities where
we operate around the world. These efforts are
critical to our business strategy.
What are you seeing in the communities and
cities in which Citi operates?
We are living during a period of unprecedented
urban growth, and the challenges facing
cities and the people living in them cannot be
underestimated. Access to financing, innovation
and new partnerships are needed now more than
ever, and Citi is well positioned to help finance and
scale solutions with impact.
One of the most pressing issues we see globally
is the widening wealth gap exemplified by tens of
millions of unemployed young people around the
world. In 2014, we launched Pathways to Progress,
a three-year $50 million commitment designed
to jump-start the career readiness of 100,000
low-income youth in 10 U.S. cities. Benefiting
nearly 25,000 youth in its first year, the program
is helping young adults set educational and
career goals, develop the necessary skills for a
21st-century economy, and contribute to the future
economic competitiveness of our cities and our
country.
What does it mean to be a good
corporate citizen?
At Citi, it starts and ends with trust. Without the
trust of the people and communities we serve,
we simply cannot do our jobs. People trust Citi
with their money and that trust is the necessary
foundation of our business. In return, we work
with our employees to meet and exceed the
highest standards of ethical behavior at all times.
Banks are still recovering from the loss of trust
resulting from the financial crisis. Over the last
year we focused on strengthening our culture
of trust with stakeholders by building a globally
consistent approach to ethics training and setting
global standards for suitability and sales practices.
We combine that trust with a deep commitment
to the communities we serve beyond our business
activities. That commitment comes to life in the
leadership role we play in tackling entrenched
economic, social and environmental challenges
facing cities and communities around the world.
¡°Given the pace and scale of global
challenges and opportunities, from
providing access to basic banking
services for the two billion people
who lack it, to training the workforce
oservices for the two billion people
who lack it, to training the workforce
of tomorrow, Citi has a unique
capacity to support economic
progress in the communities where
we operate around the world.¡±",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
578,Citigroup,4,USA,"As the leader of a U.S.-based bank with a distinctly global footprint and focus, I spend a fair amount of my time traveling around the world, meeting with clients, customers and colleagues in the more than 100 countries where we open our doors every morning. Having done that on a regular basis for years I think I¡¯m on pretty safe ground when I say that the world doesn¡¯t seem likely to get any less global, uncertain, unpredictable or challenging. This expectation only underscores our commitment to take our mission ? one that we explicitly reaffirmed and clarified over the course of the past year ? seriously. That mission is: to responsibly provide financial services that enable growth and progress. 
Whether that means enabling growth and progress through our core business activities, forging partnerships with organizations that align with our values, or providing philanthropic support through the Citi Foundation, my more than 200,000 colleagues and I work to fulfill that mission faithfully every day. Yet, we also humbly recognize that we don¡¯t have all (or even many) solutions to some of society¡¯s more daunting challenges at our fingertips. What we can do, however, and where we focus our energy, talent and best thinking, is helping our clients and customers navigate and manage through many of these issues, which often helps society move forward. Where we see places where we are confident  that we can meaningfully contribute, we do and we will. With an understanding of the priorities and concerns of our clients, partners and people,  we focus on the following issues where we engage in both breadth and depth. 
?  Culture, Conduct and Governance  We lead with these because they are fundamental to our success. If we don¡¯t get these issues right, nothing else matters ?  at risk is the credibility needed to fulfill our mission and our license to do business.
?  Financing Development Today¡¯s world is so inextricably interconnected that global companies like ours do and must continue to play an influential role in determining how responsibly business is conducted in  the countries and communities where  we operate.
?  Inclusive Cities  We say (and we mean it) that ¡°city¡± is not just in our name, it¡¯s in our DNA. For more than 200 years we have contributed to building the economic strength of cities. We¡¯ve worked to preserve the historically pivotal role of urban centers as places of progress and opportunity for the millions of people who live in and move to them every day in search of better lives for themselves and their families.
?  Trust  Safeguarding our clients¡¯ and customers¡¯ critical assets and information while holding ourselves to the highest ethical standards in all our decision-making is key to preserving deeper client relationships. We continue to invest in the training and tools required to live up to not just the letter but the spirit of every law, statute and regulation we follow.
?  Sustainability  Market activity and global convenings such as COP21 are accelerating the risks and opportunities embedded in environmentally sustainable business.  Due to the strength of environmental finance markets and the ambitions of our clients, our financing of solutions to reduce the impact of climate change has skyrocketed. After announcing our Sustainable Progress Strategy, including  a commitment to lend, invest and facilitate $100 billion over ten years to activities focused on environmental solutions, we recorded our highest annual volume of sustainable finance activity in 2015,  with $47.6 billion in transactions.
?  Talent Achieving our aspiration of being the world¡¯s most admired bank starts with and ends with us ? our people. We remain committed to bringing out the best in ourselves, our peers and our teams. 
?  Diversity  Maintaining, cultivating, and preserving a diverse and inclusive culture is paramount for us. We know that diversity of thought, backgrounds and perspectives produce better outcomes for our clients  and customers. 
?  Human Rights Few concepts are as fundamental to the advancement of a fairer, more just society than to respect, promote and protect human rights across our value chain.  Our policies are inviolable and the basis  of an enduring commitment to uphold and respect the rights of all our employees, suppliers, clients, customers, communities and countries wherever we do business.
I offer these demonstrations and proof points as tangible evidence in support of our thesis that global institutions like ours are uniquely positioned to help society address global problems on a global scale. 
And none of the negative political discourse, rancor or rhetoric about the need to ¡°break up the big banks¡± will deter us from continuing  to do what we do every day in fulfillment of our mission to enable growth and progress around the world. 
If anything, it only reinforces that commitment while helping us to appreciate the fact that, despite signs of progress, our work is never done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
336,Clorox,1,USA,"Clorox Stakeholders In fiscal year 2013, The Clorox Company reached an important milestone. On May 3, we celebrated our 100th anniversary, marking a century of providing products that consumers value. Since our founding, we¡¯ve grown into a $5.6 billion multinational manufacturer and marketer of products used every day in millions of homes, healthcare settings and other businesses around the world. As we honor our past, we also recognize our recent accomplishments and look forward, setting our sights on the future. Our Centennial Strategy was successful in a challenging environment. Almost six years ago, Clorox embarked on our Centennial Strategy, which was anchored in our mission of ¡°We make everyday life better, every day.¡± Our mission speaks to the fact that all of our products have a meaningful impact on consumers¡¯ everyday lives. And it speaks to the company¡¯s legacy of making a positive difference in our communities. While our mission is simple, it¡¯s a powerful source of inspiration for our employees who have focused relentlessly on delivering results against our Centennial Strategy objectives. We delivered strong total stockholder returns. Despite a challenging external environment, including the worst U.S. recession since World War II, we delivered total stockholder returns in the top third of our peer group. For the past five-year period beginning in fiscal year 2008, Clorox total stockholder return was 88 percent, compared to an average of 82 percent for our peer group and an average of 40 percent. for the S&P 500. And Clorox¡¯s track record of generating strong cash flow allowed us to significantly increase our dividend from $1.60 to $2.56. Between share repurchases and total annual dividends paid to stockholders, we have returned more than $2 billion in cash to our stockholders over the last five years. We delivered solid sales growth. Over a five-year period, we¡¯ve grown sales at a compounded annual growth rate of about 3 percent, due, in part, to strategic and bolt-on acquisitions as well as price increases implemented across our brands to address higher commodity costs and inflation. We¡¯ve also delivered record levels of product innovation, which contributed more than 3 percentage points of incremental sales growth in the last two fiscal years. We¡¯re also constantly striving to make products that consumers want over competitors¡¯ products, and today, more than 50 percent of our U.S. retail portfolio is made up of consumer-preferred* products. And, we¡¯ve made sustainability improvements to 35 percent of our product portfolio by enhancing our product formulas or reducing packaging materials. In addition, we¡¯re proud of our team¡¯s excellent execution of our ¡°3D¡± demand-creation model of desire, decide and delight, the cornerstone of our Centennial Strategy. We¡¯ve created high-impact marketing communications to drive consumer desire, best-in-class, in-store promotions to influence purchase decisions at the point of decide and delivered superior-quality products to delight consumers. We strengthened our portfolio of leading brands. Today, nearly 90 percent of our brands are the No.1 or No. 2 market share leaders in their categories. We¡¯ve made progress reshaping our portfolio toward faster-growing, profitable businesses by focusing on global consumer ¡°megatrends¡± of health and wellness, sustainability, multiculturalism and affordability/value: ? Addressing the emerging consumer demand for natural products, we acquired Burt¡¯s Bees¢ç, the leader in natural personal care, and launched Green Works¢ç naturally derived cleaners and g?d¢ç natural personal care products for millennial consumers. ? Building on the company¡¯s strength in disinfecting products to help reduce healthcare-acquired infections, we expanded our Professional Products business into healthcare channels. In fiscal year 2010, we acquired Caltech Industries, a U.S. leader in healthcare disinfecting products. In fiscal year 2012, we purchased Aplicare, Inc., a leader in infection prevention products for the skin, and HealthLink, which bundles a range of products for individual physicians, doctors¡¯ offices, outpatient care centers and other small healthcare facilities. ? Responding to the changing demographics in the U.S., we¡¯ve developed and marketed products for Hispanic consumers, including the Clorox Fraganzia¢ç brand of cleaners, air fresheners and spray disinfectants; Clorox CloroGel¢â, a multipurpose, bleach-based cleaner with a thicker formula; and new scents for Pine-Sol¢ç cleaners that address Hispanic consumers¡¯ appreciation for fragrance. ? In our International business, we refocused our efforts on strategic geographies and categories where we have scale and competitive advantage. We grew our Home Care business in Latin America and significantly grew our international Burt¡¯s Bees business. We drove high levels of employee engagement andelevated a new generation of senior leaders. Clorox¡¯s business strategy begins with our people. Our strong focus on the engagement, development and well-being of our 8,400 employees around the world helps ensure we have motivated people who give their best every day. We regularly survey employees to determine their level of engagement by covering such topics as their pride in the company and in their work, their satisfaction in professional development, as well as the level of discretionary effort in their day-to-day jobs. In the last few years, our employee engagement scores have significantly surpassed global benchmarks of companies. In fiscal 2013, the percentage of ¡°engaged¡± and ¡°highly engaged¡± employees reached 87 percent. We also surveyed employees around the world to capture the core attributes they value about working at Clorox. These attributes include living our values, pride in our trusted brands and products, and having opportunities to make a real impact on our business. We distilled these insights into a core employer brand ? Our Clorox: Powered by everyone¡¯s leadership, every day ? that will help us preserve and nurture the qualities that make Clorox unique. Our commitment to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion is a priority that sets Clorox apart. Focused recruiting, comprehensive training and support for our employee resource groups all contribute to our ongoing efforts to ensure diversity and inclusion is a business imperative. Since 2006, Clorox has received a perfect score in the Human Rights Campaign¡¯s Corporate Equality Index for our benefits and programs for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. And, this year, the company was named one of the 2013 ¡°Best of the Best¡± for top diversity employers by Hispanic Network Magazine. Another important part of our people strategy is robust succession planning that creates opportunities for new leaders and ensures the continuation of strong governance. In fiscal 2013, Larry Peiros, a longtime Clorox veteran who made extensive contributions to the business, retired from his post as chief operating officer (COO). We then moved to a structure of two COOs, with the appointments of Benno Dor er to executive vice president and chief operating officer ? Cleaning, International and Corporate Strategy, and George Roeth to executive vice president and chief operating officer ? Household and Lifestyle. I¡¯m pleased about the current structure of our executive team, with leaders whose extensive industry experience and strategic capabilities will continue our focus on delivering stockholder value. We integrated corporate responsibility into our business, because it¡¯s good business. More than ever, consumers and investors are voting with their wallets when it comes to companies that do the right thing. While our values have guided our success for more than 100 years, in fiscal 2010, the company established a formal corporate responsibility strategy that is tightly integrated with the business. From 2007 to 2012, we made a lot of progress in reducing the environmental impact of our operations. We reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent, energy consumption by 15 percent, water consumption by 22 percent and solid waste to landfill by 27 percent (per case of product sold). Earlier this year, Clorox was ranked No. 41 on the 2013 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World List by Corporate Knights, a Torontobased media and investment research company. The same listing placed us second among household and personal products companies. The company also received the Most Innovative Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure Policy Award by Corporate Secretary magazine. The award recognized our 2011 annual report ¡°Think Outside the Bottle,¡± which was Clorox¡¯s first time to combine its financial, environmental, social and governance performance in an integrated report. And finally, for the third consecutive year, Clorox made it to Corporate Responsibility magazine¡¯s Top 100 list of most r esponsible companies. We continue to also believe that vibrant, healthy communities play a large role in the longevity of our business. That¡¯s why The Clorox Company Foundation has awarded cash grants totaling more than $90 million to nonprofit organizations, schools and colleges since its founding in 1980. In fiscal 2013 alone, the foundation awarded more than $4 million in cash grants, while the company made product donations valued at about $15 million1, and our brands¡¯ cause marketing programs contributed another $1.3 million to deserving nonprofits. We delivered solid results in fiscal year 2013. Turning to our fiscal 2013 results2, we delivered 3 percent sales growth, driven in part by record levels of product innovation, while continuing to face a bumpy economic recovery and a fragile consumer. Overall, we are pleased with our results, which also include: ? Earnings from continuing operations that increased to $574 million, compared to $543 million in fiscal 2012 ? Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.31, an increase of 5 percent, versus fiscal 2012 of $4.10 ? Gross margin expansion of 80 basis points, up to 42.9 percent versus 42.1 per cent in fiscal 2012 ? Economic profit of $426 million, an increase of 6 percent, compared to $402 million in fiscal 2012* ? Free cash flow of $583 million, more than 10 percent of net sales, versus $428 million, or about 8 percent of net sales, in fiscal 2012** Despite this solid performance, our top-line results came in slightly lower than anticipated, primarily due to challenges we faced in the second half of the fiscal year, including unusually cold weather, which significantly impacted our Charcoal business and the overall category; declining foreign currencies in multiple international markets; and increased competitive activity in disinfecting wipes and laundry. We have plans in place to help address these challenges, including increased merchandising activity and product innovation scheduled for fiscal 2014. While one of our biggest challenges recently has been continued pressure on our margins ? particularly from high inflation, price controls and foreign currency declines in Venezuela and Argentina ? we made strong progress in rebuilding our margins in fiscal 2013, with gr oss margin up almost 1 percentage point to 42.9 percent. Once again, our track record of delivering strong cost savings made a difference in margin improvement, with a savings of more than $100 million this year. In fact, fiscal 2013 marks more than 10 consecutive years we¡¯ve delivered at least 1.5 percentage points of margin improvement from cost savings. Our 2013 year total stockholder return was a robust 19 percent, which was slightly below the averages of our peer group and S&P 500 as the broader stock market experienced a strong rebound in early 2013. Delivering superior total stockholder returns continues to be a priority in our long-term plans, as evidenced by our superior five-year returns during our Centennial Strategy period. To this end, in May we increased our quarterly cash dividend by nearly 11 percent, making fiscal 2013 the 36th consecutive year we¡¯ve increased total annual dividends paid to our stockholders. Our 2020 Strategy continues the company¡¯s focus on delivering stockholder value. Our sights are now set on 2020, with a strategy that builds on the success of the past six years and directs the company to the highest-value opportunities for long-term profitable growth and strong total stockholder returns. Specifically, our long-term financial targets include sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and EBIT1 margin growth of 25 to 50 basis points. With a commitment to maintaining a healthy dividend, our goal is to continue delivering total stockholder returns in the top third of our peer group. To accomplish our 2020 goals, we¡¯ve chosen to focus on the following strategies: Engage our people as business owners. We want to enable our team across the entire company to become even more effective by empowering them to make decisions faster and supporting them to work more efficiently by simplifying operational processes. At the core, it¡¯s about moving toward a more agile enterprise ? harnessing everyone¡¯s leadership and doing everything we can to enable Clorox people to make an impact each and every day. Support the long-term health of our brands through more targeted 3D plans and product innovation. We plan to evolve our 3D demand-creation model of desire, decide and delight to engage with consumers in a more meaningful way and ensure we¡¯re addressing their product needs. This evolution will include seeking more granular insights about when and where consumers are open to communications, and expanding our digital capabilities to better target and personalize consumer messages and address the growing role of e-commerce. We¡¯ll look to enhance our supply chain to be more flexible and better anticipate the needs of consumers and customers. We¡¯ll also continue to focus on the value proposition of our brands, emphasizing product superiority and meaningful innovation. Grow in profitable new categories, channels and countries. Our strategy also includes pursuing businesses in expanding markets with strong profit potential. These opportunities ? whether they¡¯re adjacent categories in which our brands can be successful, new sales channels such as healthcare facilities, or countries where we want to expand our product offerings ? should be large enough to be meaningful to Clorox and have competitive dynamics that leverage our brand strengths and our superior demand-creation capabilities. Fund growth by reducing waste in our work, products and supply chain. As we continue our transformation into an even more agile enterprise, we¡¯re placing the consumer at the center of everything we do. When it comes to our day-to-day tasks and operational processes, we¡¯ll focus on work that drives the highest value to our consumers ? and ultimately leads to profitable growth. This means eliminating waste, or ineffective work, across the enterprise. Delivering strong cost savings, reducing selling and administrative expenses to 14 percent or less of sales over time and driving our sustainability initiatives are priorities that will help reduce waste and fund growth. When I think about our Centennial Strategy performance and our vision for 2020, the term ¡°constancy of purpose¡± comes to mind. We¡¯ve set clear goals and aspirations for our next set of milestones. We¡¯re leveraging the power of our brands, building on proven results and focused on a purposeful strategy, while remaining grounded in strong principles of corporate responsibility and always remembering our greatest competitive advantage is our people. Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Donald R. Knauss
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

337,Clorox,2,USA,"Looking back at fiscal year 2014, it was clearly a challenging year for our business and our industry. Our results were significantly impacted by a number of pressures, including unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, soft U.S. retail categories, heightened competitive activity and higher raw material costs.Fiscal year 2014 financial results included:
?   Earnings from continuing operations of $562 million versus  $574 million in fiscal year 2013 ?   Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations  of $4.26 versus $4.31 in fiscal year 2013 ?   Sales decrease of slightly more than half a percentage point (nearly 2 percent increase, currency neutral) 1 ?   EBIT margin of 17.2 percent versus 17.3 percent in fiscal  year 2013 1 Fiscal year 2014 was a catalyst for change. While we¡¯re disappointed with these results, fiscal year 2014 was a catalyst for change ? changes that will ensure our brands have the necessary support to regain market share and topline momentum. In the fourth quarter, we stepped up our plans to address these challenges, including investing $20 million in incremental demandbuilding programs to reinforce the value proposition of our brands, reinvigorate our categories and profitably grow market share. While it will take time to realize the full benefit of our investment, we believe these investments across our 3D demand creation model of desire (prepurchase communications), decide (point- of-purchase communications) and delight (product experience) will help us to achieve our objectives. 
Notwithstanding the challenges we faced this fiscal year, Clorox people achieved positive results, including:
?   3 percentage points of incremental sales from product innovation ?   $122 million in cost savings, delivering our 11th consecutive year of average cost savings of $100 million ?   Free cash flow of $633 million, or 11 percent of net sales, an increase of $50 million versus fiscal year 2013 1 ?   Sustainability improvements to 15 percent of our product  portfolio since our baseline calendar year of 2011 2
?   Living safety as a core value with a world-class recordable  incident rate of .69 across our operations 3
We also made progress toward our corporate responsibility (CR) goals, including a 34 percent reduction in the amount of waste  we send to landfill and a 12 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2011.2 Since 2008, our sustainability initiatives have averaged $15 million in cost savings annually, helping to offset raw material cost increases and enabling investments in innovation and demand creation. 
We continued to drive diversity and inclusion, once again surpassing the U.S. census diversity figures and earning another 100 percent rating in the Human Rights Campaign¡¯s Corporate Equality Index. In a challenging year, Clorox people stepped up with a commitment and focus that exemplifies the attributes of our strong employer brand ? OurClorox: Powered by everyone¡¯s leadership, every day. All 8,200 Clorox employees know their contributions are critical to the company¡¯s success, and this year¡¯s employee engagement score of 86 percent, 9 percentage points higher than the global fast-moving consumer goods industry norm, reflects this strong connection.4 Finally, a number of external organizations recognized our CR performance and commitment to transparency, including CR Magazine, which ranked us No. 29 on its 100 Best Corporate Citizens list, and Newsweek, which ranked us No. 43 on its 2014 Green Rankings. 
We continued our commitment to return cash  to shareholders. Total shareholder return of 14 percent for the fiscal year placed  Clorox above our peer group average. One of the company¡¯s  priorities is to use its strong cash flow to return excess cash to shareholders. In fiscal year 2014, we repurchased more than  3 million shares and returned $368 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. As we have done every year since 1977, we raised our annual cash dividend, announcing in the fourth quarter an increase of nearly 4 percent, taking our dividend to $2.96 per share from $2.84 per share. As of August 25, 2014, Clorox¡¯s  current dividend yield of 3.3 percent is one of the highest in  our industry. 
Fiscal year 2015 is the year of value. As much as 2014 was a catalyst for change, 2015 is the year of value. Our 2020 Strategy sets clear business and corporate responsibility objectives to ensure everyone at Clorox is focused on value creation for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Creating value for consumers means delivering superior, innovative products that delight and making it clear why they should buy our products. For our employees, it means supporting an inclusive and diverse culture that provides opportunities for growth. For customers, it means helping them drive their business and grow our categories. For our communities, it means supporting organizations that provide services around education, health and well-being. As we do each of these things well, we create value for all of our stakeholders. 
To accomplish our 2020 goals, we are focused on the following strategies:
Engage our people as business owners. In fiscal year 2015, we will continue Clorox¡¯s transformation into an even more agile enterprise that empowers employees to make decisions faster and simplifies operational processes. At the core, this strategy is about harnessing everyone¡¯s leadership and doing everything we can to enable Clorox people to make a positive impact each and every day.
Increase brand investment behind superior value and more  targeted 3D innovation. One of our priorities continues to be revitalizing our categories and profitably growing market shares. Our 3D demand-creation model helps ensure we¡¯re connecting with consumers in relevant ways and addressing their needs with meaningful product innovation. In the coming year, we will focus on hard-hitting claims in consumer communications and on packaging to drive home the superior value of our brands. And we are committing more funds in fiscal year 2015 to make that happen.
Grow into profitable new categories, channels and countries. Our strategy includes leveraging our leading brands to pursue businesses and expanding markets with strong profit potential. Whether it¡¯s focusing on adjacent categories in which our brands can be successful, new sales channels or countries, these opportunities should be large enough to be meaningful to Clorox and 
have competitive dynamics that leverage our brand strengths and demand-creation capabilities. In fiscal year 2015, among other priorities, we¡¯ll continue to leverage our strong brands for licensing opportunities in our U.S. retail business, build on Burt¡¯s Bees¢ç growth internationally and look for opportunities to expand our Professional Products business into more healthcare channels.
Fund growth by reducing waste in our work, products and  supply chain. As we continue our agile enterprise transformation, serving our consumers is job one. We¡¯re focused on work that drives the highest value for our consumers and ultimately drives more profitable growth. In fiscal year 2015, delivering strong cost savings, reducing selling and administrative expenses and driving our sustainability initiatives will continue to be priorities to drive productivity gains and fund growth. We remain committed to strong shareholder returns. As I reflect on the long term, I believe we have the right strategy, great brands and great people to deliver superior value for the consumer and achieve our 2020 goals. Our focus on total shareholder return continues to be the center of everything we do,  and we have what it takes to succeed in this environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
338,Clorox,3,USA,"I¡¯m deeply honored to be leading The Clorox Company. We have a strong foundation with a healthy core business and momentum behind our categories and market shares. We also have highly engaged and talented employees as well as a diverse portfolio of leading brands that fulfill our mission to make everyday life better, every day, for people around the world. We¡¯ve come a long way since 1913 when the company started with five people and one product in Clorox¢ç bleach, and we¡¯re at a pivotal point in building an even bolder future.The 21st century is an exciting and highly complex era for our industry considering the fundamental changes in technology and digital media, which are transforming the way we do business. Notably, consumers are in charge and, more than ever, they demand superior value from their purchases. They have unlimited access to information and countless options for how and where to buy practically anything. They¡¯re also highly diverse, representing different age groups, interests, backgrounds and traditions, all of which influence their product choices. 
Every day I think about what it¡¯s going to take to win with our consumers and how Clorox will get to its bolder future. There¡¯s a lot to be said for continuity of purpose. Retaining our commitment to corporate responsibility is not negotiable, and we believe we have the right strategy to succeed. At the same time, our future success also depends on challenging  the status quo and getting ahead of the changes we¡¯re  seeing in business today.
That¡¯s why our single biggest challenge and opportunity is to accelerate good growth ? growth that¡¯s profitable, consistent and achieved in a responsible way. We can¡¯t rely on favorable economic trends or a growing population to create momentum for our business. We¡¯re taking charge of our own destiny in a challenging economic environment. 
We¡¯re confident that our 2020 Strategy will help us successfully navigate these dynamics and deliver good growth:
  Engage our people: It takes everyone¡¯s leadership to drive growth. We must empower employees to be more decisive in driving results faster. In addition, we believe they should mirror the consumers we serve around the world, which is why it¡¯s imperative to continue fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion.   increase investments behind our brands: Winning with consumers starts with increasing investments behind our brands to demonstrate our superior value proposition. We must delight people with superior products and lead technology-enabled change to engage them through real-time ¡°sense and respond¡± marketing.  Expand our brands into new categories and new sales channels and in existing countries: Innovation, partnerships and entering into new channels, including e-commerce, will create new opportunities to leverage the leadership of our brands to drive incremental growth.   Cut waste in our work, products and supply chain to fuel growth: Providing value to our  consumers means  relentlessly focusing on  what matters to them.  By reducing costs that  don¡¯t matter, we can reinvest savings and resources to drive growth. 
ExCEllEnt ExECutiOn OF OuR StRAtEGy dROvE StROnG PERFORMAnCE in FiSCAl yEAR 2015. In the last fiscal year, our 7,700 employees rose to the  challenge of driving profitable growth while continuing to  live up to our corporate responsibility commitments. I¡¯m pleased with our results:  We increased sales in every quarter, with sales growth  of 3 percent for the fiscal year (5 percent growth,  currency neutral).1  We launched new products in many categories, delivering 3 points of incremental sales growth.  We drove productivity gains, delivering $116 million in cost savings.  We expanded our gross margin by 90 basis points to  43.6 percent.
  We increased free cash flow as a percentage of sales by 13 percent to $733 million, the highest level we¡¯ve delivered in 10 years.1  We made sustainability improvements to 20 percent  of our product portfolio since our baseline calendar  year of 20112, and we¡¯re on track with our goal to make sustainability improvements to 50 percent of our product portfolio by 2020. 
Importantly, we achieved these results in the right way ? responsibly and guided by our values. Safety is a core value, and we posted the lowest recordable incident rate in our history, which was also better than world-class levels.3 In  addition, employee engagement increased about 1 point to more than 86 percent, 9 points higher than the fast-moving consumer goods industry norm and about 1 point higher than the global high-performance norm.4 
We¡¯ve been recognized for our strong diversity and inclusion programs, and this year we introduced a network to engage and support our employees who are veterans. We also continued to focus on reducing our environmental impact, lowering our greenhouse gas emissions by 11 percent, water usage by 11 percent and waste to landfill by 30 percent, cumulatively, since 2011.2 It meant a lot to all of us that Clorox was recognized by a number of external organizations, including Corporate Responsibility magazine, which ranked us No. 37 on its Best Corporate Citizens list, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which gave us two Climate Leadership Awards for excellence in greenhouse gas management. 
I¡¯m especially proud of our results in light of tough challenges we faced in the fiscal year, including slowing international  economies and foreign currency declines across all major  currencies. In particular, our Venezuela business had been  experiencing sustained operating losses from triple-digit inflation impacting much of our product input costs. 
While we very much wanted to remain in Venezuela, we were forced to discontinue our operations. It was a very difficult time for the company, but today our business is stronger for it. Moving forward, our International business continues to play an important role in our portfolio.  
Considering the macroeconomic headwinds we¡¯re facing, our focus for International is to rebuild margins. Once these headwinds subside, our International business will be in a solid position to benefit. We have leading brands that are growing market share, and we have promising growth  platforms, including the Burt¡¯s Bees¢ç brand, which is now  in more than 40 countries.
StRAtEGy ACCElERAtORS ARE kEy tO  dElivERinG GOOd GROwth FAStER. In fiscal year 2015, we wasted no time leaning into the highest opportunities to drive good growth and introduced four ¡°accelerators¡± to help us execute our 2020 Strategy moving forward:   We¡¯re doubling down on 3D Innovation to create even more value from innovation. Innovative thinking and execution must be applied to everything that touches our demand-creation model of desire, decide and delight ? from product development to sales and marketing to manufacturing. Through 3D Technology Transformation, we¡¯re tapping into the latest technology advancements to deliver the right message to the right consumer at the right moment, while generating a stronger return on our investments.  Our focus on Portfolio Momentum is about directing more resources to the brands that we expect to deliver the most growth.   We¡¯re building an even stronger Growth Culture so that employees are more empowered and decisive in driving results and, importantly, put the consumer first in  everything they do. In the last fiscal year, execution of our strategy accelerators paid off in category growth and market share gains, with  the fourth quarter showing the highest market share growth  in four years.
wE COntinuEd OuR COMMitMEnt tO REtuRn CASh tO ShAREhOldERS. In fiscal year 2015, we returned $385 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. As we¡¯ve done every year since 1977, we raised our annual cash dividend, announcing in the fourth quarter an increase of 4 percent. As of Aug. 21, 2015, Clorox¡¯s current dividend yield of 2.8 percent is one of the highest in our industry, and our total shareholder return of 17 percent for fiscal year 2015 ranked Clorox fourth in our peer group.

It fuels our  performance, guiding our everyday choices and applying  our values to how we treat each other and everyone who touches our business. Whether we¡¯re trying to attract  consumers, customers or employees, making great products is no longer enough. Consumers ? and particularly millennials,  a group that will soon surpass baby boomers in purchasing power ? want to know what a company stands for. It¡¯s our job to make sure our stakeholders know Clorox is absolutely committed to doing the right thing in every aspect of our  business, from our people to our governance to our products. 
This is an exciting time to be at Clorox, and we¡¯ve really only just begun. With a strong foundation of talented people, leading brands and the right strategy, we¡¯re defining new  opportunities that will help us accelerate good growth, deliver value to all our stakeholders and lead us to a bolder future where we¡¯re an even greater company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
579,Clorox,4,USA,"Over the years we¡¯ve evolved our geographical footprint beyond the U.S. and now have leading brands in many countries. We¡¯ve evolved the diversity and capabilities of our people to better serve our consumers around the world. And, we¡¯ve evolved our global portfolio to include a variety of cleaning and healthcare products as well as natural personal care, food, charcoal, water filtration, cat litter, trash bags, food storage and more.
In fiscal year 2016, evolution continued in our quest to deliver good growth: growth that¡¯s profitable, sustainable and achieved responsibly. We¡¯ve strengthened our commitment to corporate responsibility to ensure we continue to achieve our results the right way. We¡¯ve continued to enhance our demand-creation programs, with product innovation across many brands and digital marketing communications to deliver even more targeted messages to consumers. And, with the recent acquisition of the Renew Life¢ç business, our portfolio now includes a leader in digestive health, putting us in an even better position to fulfill our mission to make everyday life better, every day.
WE DELIVERED ANOTHER YEAR OF SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. Excellent execution of our 2020 Strategy drove strong results: ? We grew sales 2 percent; excluding a 3-point impact  of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, we  grew sales 5 percent.1 ? We drove productivity gains, delivering $109 million  in cost savings. ? We expanded our gross margin by 150 basis points  to 45.1 percent. ? We delivered 8 percent diluted earnings per share  growth, even while increasing our investments  behind demand-creation programs.
We view our business holistically, and I¡¯m equally proud of our results beyond financial performance. We posted a recordable incident rate of 0.612  in the workplace, delivering another year of worldclass safety. Once again, we¡¯ve been recognized for our strong  diversity and inclusion programs, receiving another 100 percent score from the Human Rights Campaign for our LGBT workplace practices and being named one of the best places to work by  Diversity MBA magazine. We also continued to drive our eco  strategy, making sustainability improvements to 31 percent of our 
product portfolio  since our baseline calendar year of 2011,3 and we¡¯re on track with our goal to make sustainability improvements to 50 percent of our product portfolio by 2020. We also lowered our greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent , water usage by  14 percent , energy usage by 14 percent  and waste-to-landfill by 25 percent , cumulatively, since 2011. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency named us a 2016 Safer Choice Partner of the Year, and Corporate Responsibility Magazine again included us among the top 100 companies on its Best Corporate Citizens list.
I¡¯m especially proud of our achievements in the face of continuing macroeconomic challenges in fiscal year 2016, including ongoing foreign currency headwinds that challenged our international business and overall company results. Even so, our strategic choices, including increased investments in our U.S. brands and select growth initiatives in International, drove strong results, with very good top- and bottom-line growth as well as market share increases. 
WE EVOLVED OUR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGY BY JOINING THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT. True to our commitment to good growth, we achieved our fiscal year 2016 results the right way ? with corporate responsibility serving as the cornerstone of our business. In fiscal year 2016, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, the world¡¯s largest organization that¡¯s bringing companies, nongovernmental organizations, governments and other stakeholders together to advance the most important global sustainability issues. As a signatory to the UNGC, we affirm our commitment to its Ten Principles by driving our corporate responsibility strategy, a comprehensive set of  commitments across our company ? from human rights, labor and product safety to transparency, environmental sustainability and contributions to communities where we operate. We believe joining the UNGC is a meaningful next step in our CR journey, giving us an opportunity to continue learning from and sharing ideas with key sustainability influencers and other member companies.
WE¡¯VE EVOLVED OUR PORTFOLIO EVEN  FURTHER INTO HEALTH AND WELLNESS. Over the years we¡¯ve shaped our portfolio with brands that make a meaningful difference in the health and wellness of our consumers. A few noteworthy examples are Clorox¢ç bleach, which kills germs that make people sick in homes, public places and healthcare settings; Brita¢ç water filters, which provide great-tasting water, a healthier beverage option than sugary drinks; and the Burt¡¯s Bees¢ç brand, which offers high-quality natural personal care products to nourish the face and body. Health and wellness is not only our past and present, it¡¯s our future. In fiscal year 2016, we acquired the Renew Life¢ç line of probiotics, cleanses and digestive aids, giving us the ability to make a difference in the digestive health of consumers around the world. Two-thirds of U.S. adults have experienced digestive issues in the past year, and that population is likely to increase. We know consumers are interested in the $10 billion digestive health category, but they¡¯re also confused by the many different brands and products available, all with different claims. That¡¯s where a company of strong marketers, like Clorox, can help consumers make more informed decisions.
WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THE WELL-BEING OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD. A priority for the Clorox management team is to focus on high levels of employee engagement since we know there¡¯s a strong correlation between engagement and long-term company performance. Our current engagement score of 87 percent,4  8 points higher than the fast-moving consumer goods industry norm and about 3 points higher than the global high-performance norm, is something that makes me especially proud. Our values-based culture and people programs, including diversity and inclusion, health and wellness, and development and recognition, play a strong part in engaging the heads and hearts of our people. 
We also believe that vibrant and healthy communities play an  important role in the health of our business. In fiscal year 2016, our total impact to support our communities came to approximately $17 million in cash grants, cause marketing contributions, product donations and employee volunteer hours.
WE CONTINUED OUR COMMITMENT  TO RETURN CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS. In fiscal year 2016, we returned $398 million in cash dividends to our stockholders. As we¡¯ve done every year since 1977, we raised our annual cash dividend, announcing in the fourth quarter an  increase of 4 percent. As of August 2016, Clorox¡¯s dividend yield was 2.2 percent. Our total stockholder return of 36 percent for fiscal year 2016 ranked Clorox third in our peer group. 
EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS, GUIDED BY OUR 2020 STRATEGY, WILL CONTINUE IN FISCAL YEAR 2017. Evolution in fiscal year 2017 will continue with our focus on making progress against our 2020 Strategy accelerators. We¡¯ll continue to create meaningful value from 3D Innovation across our demand- creation model; through 3D Technology Transformation we¡¯ll continue to tap into the latest technology advancements to deliver the right message to the right consumer at the right time, while generating a strong return on our brand investments; through Portfolio Momentum, we¡¯ll continue to direct more resources to the brands that we expect to deliver the most growth; and we¡¯ll continue to step up our game by living our Growth Culture and defining new opportunities to help us deliver good growth. What won¡¯t change is our commitment to corporate responsibility. It¡¯s the foundation of everything we do in our goal to continue delivering value to all our stakeholders.

339,Coca-Cola Co.,1,USA,"Sustainability is at the heart of the Coca-Cola story. Together with our bottling partners, we¡¯ve long worked to build stronger, healthier, more active communities and advance environmental conservation. Why? Because we know our business can only be as healthy, vibrant and resilient as the communities we proudly serve. For decades, our Company?like many others?has worked to be part of society¡¯s solutions. Coca-Cola, for example, was promoting physical activity in the 1930s, varied size and packaging choices in the 1950s and anti-litter campaigns in the 1960s. And our first diet cola, TaB, debuted 50 years ago. Today, we¡¯re advancing 21st century solutions by partnering across the golden triangle of business, government and civil society. We feel a special accountability?as a business that operates on a global scale?to help improve the well-being of our communities while doing what we can to responsibly steward the natural resources of the planet we all share. For us, this is a journey. We¡¯re making progress as we create social value and strive to operate in ever more sustainable ways. After all, as we like to think about it, we¡¯re not building                              The Coca-Cola Company so much for the       next quarter, but the next century. Taking the long view has served us well. We are calling attention to and affecting positive change on global issues that have a significant 
impact on building a more sustainable and resilient value chain ? not only for our Company, but also the communities we proudly serve. We at The Coca-Cola Company firmly believe there are no issues that will more shape or define the 21st century than the global empowerment of women; the management of the world¡¯s precious water resources; and the well-being of the world¡¯s growing population. Let me share with you our progress on each of these priorities: Women: We continue advancing our 5by20 initiatives to enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs across our global value chain by 2020. From fruit farmers and artisans to microdistribution center owners, we are helping women entrepreneurs overcome the barriers they face to business success by providing them with professional training, support networks and access to finance. In just three years, our 5by20 programs enabled 300,000 women in more than 12 countries?more than double the number of participants in 2011. Water: At Coca-Cola, we understand that water is absolutely vital to our business. As such, we¡¯ve set a goal to replenish 100 percent of the water used to make our beverages by 2020. To date, about 52 percent of our global product volume is estimated to be replenished through 468 community water projects around the world. These projects take many forms, from 
October rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation to safe water access and sanitation. Our safe water efforts also include our partnership with DEKA R&D to place between 1,500 and 2,000 EKOCENTERs  (a kiosk designed to improve the well-being of communities) or Slingshot water purification systems in 20 countries by the end of 2015. In addition, we¡¯re working to improve our water efficiency, which we define as the amount of water we use per liter of product, by 25 percent through operational advancements across our system. This goal builds on the 21.4 percent improvement we¡¯ve already made between 2004 and 2012. Well-being: Our business continues to be built on a heritage of uncompromising quality? the promise that all our beverages are safe, refreshing and delicious. Today across 200plus countries and territories, we offer the choice of more than 500 brands and 3,500 beverages, with the health and well-being of our consumers playing a large and growing role in the development of our brands. While some of our beverages are designed for local tastes, our well-being commitments are universal. As we announced on May 8, 2013, our teams are working to provide low- and no-calorie beverage options in every market; provide transparent nutrition information featuring calories on the front of all our packages; market all our beverages responsibly; and help get people moving by supporting active, healthy living programs in every country where we do business. As we work to double the overall size of our business over the course of this decade, we are further embedding sustainability with our 2020 Vision for growth. In this report?our 
most comprehensive to date, demonstrating our commitment to increased transparency? we present our leadership priorities of women, water and well-being, which are rooted in an expanded set of sustainability goals announced earlier this year. These priorities are integral to our sustainability framework, which we call ¡°Me, We, World¡±?our shared vision for how we can work together to create more value for our consumers and communities. We are collaborating across the golden triangle with a variety of extraordinary organizations to advance our progress. The cumulative expertise of our partners both inspires and enables us to do far more than we could alone. As we strive to improve each and every community we proudly serve, we continue to support the United Nations Global Compact. Thank you for your interest in the efforts of The Coca-Cola Company and our valued bottling partners. We appreciate you taking the time to review this report, and invite you to share your thoughts with us. Together, I¡¯m convinced that we will continue to refresh the world, inspire moments of optimism and happiness, create value and make a positive difference.

340,Coca-Cola Co.,2,USA,"On behalf of everyone at The Coca-Cola Company, thank you for your interest in our sustainability journey.As a company and a worldwide  system that includes our bottling partners,  Coca-Cola is committed to creating value for the communities we proudly serve and the planet we all share. 
Sustainability is at the heart of our business. And as a business, we know that sustainability efforts are themselves only sustainable when they help our enterprise grow and prosper. Indeed, we believe this work must be integral to our mission of refreshing the world, inspiring moments of optimism and happiness, creating value and making a difference.
As a result, we¡¯ve chosen to focus our leadership on three areas of fundamental importance to our business?areas where we believe we have the best opportunity to make a lasting positive difference. We call them the ¡°Three Ws¡±: Women, Water and Well-Being. We also continue to implement sustainability programs across other areas of our operations.
We know that we don¡¯t have all the answers, all the access or all the know-how. On the contrary, we believe that, in a world of great challenges and even greater opportunities, we must work side by side with our bottling and industry partners, non-governmental organizations, universities, government agencies and others.
Working together, we can unlock the collaborative power of the ¡°Golden Triangle¡± of business, government and civil society organizations, making a much greater collective impact than any one organization or even sector could hope to achieve alone.
As for our overarching goals, we¡¯re striving to enable the economic empowerment of  5 million Women entrepreneurs within our global value chain by 2020. Since launching this initiative, which we call 5by20¢â, in 2010, we¡¯ve made a difference in the lives of more than 550,000 women and their families as we pilot, scale and replicate the best ideas.
In Water, we¡¯re working to balance the water we use by 2020, returning to communities and nature an amount of water equal to that used in our beverages and their production. We¡¯re currently on track to achieve this water goal, replenishing an estimated 68 percent of the volume of our finished beverages in 2013 and returning a calculated 108.5 billion liters to communities and nature.
As for Well-Being, we¡¯re committed to, among other things, helping our consumers make informed choices by providing an ever expanding selection of reduced-, low-, and nocalorie beverages along with front-of-package nutritional labeling. And we¡¯re working toward our goal to support physical activity programs in each of the more than 200 markets we serve by 2020. To date, we¡¯ve supported more than 290 programs in nearly 125 countries and territories.
In how we operate, we¡¯ve made great strides in our packaging initiatives with focus on recycling programs and innovations like PlantBottle¢â packaging?the first commercially scalable plastic bottle made partially from plants. Meeting ambitious goals is always challenging work, and progress in some areas has been slower than we would like. 
For example, we had hoped to source 25 percent of our PET plastic from recycled or renewable material by 2015. To date, we¡¯ve reached six percent. One hurdle here has been posed by regulatory restrictions on the use of recycled material in drink packaging. Another has been the rising cost of recycled plastic due to higher demand. We¡¯re now working on both issues, encouraging regulatory reform and higher rates of recycling, which should help control costs.
Of course, as a worldwide business that operates locally in almost every corner of the globe, our sustainability efforts go beyond our three key focus areas. We also support and measure our sustainability progress against the principles outlined in the United Nations Global Compact and Millennium Development Goals.
Day by day, week by week, month by month, The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling partners are moving forward on our sustainability journey. I invite you to follow our progress on Coca-Cola Journey. Your input is invaluable as we aim to improve and grow our business the right way?sustainably. We look forward to hearing from you.  
Very best wishes, 
Muhtar Kent Chairman of the Board and  Chief Executive Officer The Coca-Cola Company
The growth opportunities are strong for the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry, as the global middle class grows and more people move from rural areas to live in cities. Even so, we see a number of challenges to our industry, from sedentary lifestyles and obesity to locally stressed water supplies, evolving consumer tastes and increasing competition. 
The Coca-Cola Company is taking action to overcome each of these challenges while continuing to offer high quality and refreshing beverages to consumers all around the world. And we believe our sustainability efforts have an essential role to play in helping to mitigate risks and create new business opportunities.  
Overall, I¡¯d say we¡¯re making good progress in most areas of sustainability. Even so, we¡¯re far from satisfied. Instead, we remain constructively discontent as we seek out new innovations and innovative ways of working with others across the Golden Triangle. 
As we pursue our 2020 Vision goal of doubling the size of our business over the course of this decade, we know it will take next-level creativity, partnerships, marketing, distribution and marketplace execution. Achieving our 2020 Vision will also require us to operate more sustainably. For our business. For our stakeholders. And for the broader world beyond.

341,Coca-Cola Co.,3,USA,"As we strive to refresh the world, The Coca-Cola Company and our local bottling partners are committed to creating new value for our consumers, our customers and the communities we proudly serve across more than 200 countries and territories. 
Every day, we get up with a passion for making a lasting, positive difference in people¡¯s lives. As we do, we¡¯re continuously seeking to better integrate our sustainability efforts into our daily actions.
This, to us, is the secret formula for making our business more sustainable: integrating sustainability into the very heart of the enterprise, where our efforts create value for our shareowners and the wider world beyond. 
As you¡¯ll see in this report, we made significant progress in 2014 in advancing our top three sustainability priorities in support of Women, Water and Well-Being. In terms of Women, we increased the total number of women entrepreneurs impacted by our 5by20¢â initiative to nearly 865,000 since 2010. We continue to replicate and scale effective programs as we pursue the economic empowerment of 5 million women worldwide by 2020. Through our Water programs, we balanced the equivalent of an estimated 94 percent of the water used in our finished beverages in 2014, putting us on track to potentially meet our 100 percent water replenishment target ahead of 2020. 
In Well-Being, we continue our commitment to inspire happier, healthier lives. We introduced more than 100 reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverages, continued to increase the availability of small packages, and supported more than 330 active, healthy living programs across 112 markets.
Our success in these priorities is directly linked to our system¡¯s sustainable business growth. We advance toward our 2020 sustainability commitments by unlocking the collaborative power of the ¡°Golden Triangle¡± of business, government and civil society. Indeed, some of our most exciting opportunities come from programs at the intersection of Women, Water and Well-Being like Project Unnati or EKOCENTER¢â?initiatives that serve to strengthen our supply chain, our business and our communities. 
We¡¯ve seen success from programs that reinforce our enduring view that sustainability spurs innovation, just as innovation spurs sustainability. One example is EKOCYCLE¢â, which encourages recycling by using recycled materials such as plastic bottles and aluminum cans to create desirable consumer products. 
As an industry leader, we often choose to set demanding targets that drive fundamental change, even while 
understanding that attaining such goals is not guaranteed. For example, we committed our system to work toward buying and installing only HFC-free coolers by 2015. While we¡¯ve led the industry and placed more than 1.4 million such coolers in the market?including approximately 297,500 in 2014?we are off track to reach this goal. Sourcing HFC-free coolers presents challenges in many markets, but we continue to make progress, having invested more than $100 million over the past decade to make our coolers more environmentally friendly.
Overall, we are pleased?but not satisfied?with our sustainability progress and the milestones we¡¯ve reached. As we advance our reporting and disclosures, we continue to support and measure our sustainability progress against the principles outlined in the United Nations Global Compact. For this year and beyond, we¡¯re committed to building on the successes of 2014, further integrating sustainability into our business and gaining fresh momentum. 
Thank you for your interest in The  Coca-Cola Company and our sustainability report. I invite you to follow our progress on Coca-Cola Journey. As we keep moving toward our 2020 sustainability commitments, we welcome your input and look forward to hearing from you.?

revenue and cost control, led to our third consecutive profitable year. We
shared that success by giving $372 million in profit sharing and $91 million in
operations bonuses to our employees.
Our commitment to addressing our impact on the environment has never been
stronger. We reduced our water consumption and recycled 48 percent of our
non-hazardous waste in 2012. We also reduced our annual aircraft greenhouse
gas emissions by 8.4 million metric tons compared to 2005, an 18.5 percent
reduction. In addition, we posted our third-party verified 2005-2011 greenhouse
gas emissions on The Climate Registry, a nonprofit organization with established standards for calculating,
verifying and publicly reporting carbon footprints.
High fuel prices have become the new normal for our business, so we purchased an oil refinery that is expected
to produce at least $300 million in cost savings annually. And when it comes to making fleet decisions, efficiency
and environmental factors play a significant role.
We are dramatically reducing the number of 50-seat regional jets we operate, replacing them with larger twoclass
aircraft that are far more fuel efficient. In addition to lowering our emissions, customers tend to prefer the
larger jets because they offer amenities customers prefer, such as first class cabins, in-flight Wi-Fi and Economy
Comfort seating.
We made several strategic investments that help customers conveniently travel around the world. To strengthen
our global network, we¡¯ve made investments to form lasting partnerships with Aeromexico, GOL and Virgin
Atlantic Airways. We¡¯ve also deepened our existing ties to partners Alaska Airlines and Virgin Australia. Our financial success underwrites Delta¡¯s social responsibility. We contributed millions of dollars through direct
donations and employee contributions to a host of civic causes around the globe as part of Delta¡¯s Force for
Global Good. We are particularly proud of the Habitat for Humanity homes we built or rehabilitated in 2012.
Our company values include building a great place to work and encouraging employee engagement in the
communities where we live and work.

efficient air travel. We are a values-based business and focus all of our long-term,
strategic decisions on building and maintaining a sustainable business for our employees,
our customers and our shareowners. This commitment naturally extends to the
communities in which Delta people live and work.
Through teamwork and a commitment to common values and goals, Delta in 2013
reported a $2.7 billion profit, excluding special items; paid more than $500 million
in profit sharing for Delta people; and provided a $350 million return of capital to
our shareholders. Delta was listed once again on the S&P 500; delivered operational

580,Delta Air Lines,4,USA,"Delta had a record year in 2015, with industry-leading operational reliability,
investment-grade financial performance and unparalleled profit-sharing payouts. We
have the right people, principles and guidelines in place to drive our business forward.
The people of Delta are breaking the mold and setting a new standard for airlines.
While our industry remains volatile and faces ever-present challenges like fluctuating
fuel prices and global unrest, Delta is focused on building a nimble and sustainable
airline that can be profitable in good times and bad. We hold not only our business
but our global supply chain to rigorous standards.
Since I assumed the position of CEO in 2016, I¡¯ve often been asked, ¡°What¡¯s Delta¡¯s
secret?¡± My reply is always the same - there is no secret. Anyone flying Delta can see
that we have the best employees in the business, 84,000 of them. They are the Delta
Difference and will ensure that the Delta culture lives on.
Delta people are empowered to innovate and always find a way to say ¡°yes¡± to
our customers. Building long-lasting relationships with our customers increases
the sustainability of our business, and we strive each day to provide the most
reliable, safe and convenient experience possible on every flight and through every
interaction. Continuing to elevate the product and service we offer is imperative to our
continued success.
We also are investing in the long-term health of our community partners. Together,
Delta Air Lines, The Delta Air Lines Foundation and Delta employees contribute
thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars to a host of philanthropic causes.
Delta provided more than 1.5 million meals to more than 10 food banks, donated
6,642 pints of blood to the American Red Cross, and built or rehabilitated 221 homes
in 12 countries with Habitat for Humanity, all in 2015.We¡¯re raising the bar in 2016. Moving forward, Delta has committed to contribute
1 percent of its net income from the previous year to key charitable organizations.
This commitment will be fulfilled through cash contributions and in-kind travel, as
well as grants from The Delta Air Lines Foundation. In 2016, Delta is projected to give
$37 million to charitable organizations worldwide.
While we celebrate our successes, we remain cognizant that the size and scale of our
operation has an impact on the environment. Delta flies more than 5,000 flights a day
around the globe. Jet fuel accounts for more than 98 percent of our carbon footprint.
That¡¯s why we are putting our business under the microscope and implementing
measures to be a more carbon-conscious company in the air and on the ground.
Delta teams around the globe are hard at work implementing fuel-saving initiatives.
For example, we actively seek financially and environmentally sustainable fleet
enhancements, phasing out less fuel-efficient planes, like the Boeing 747, and
replacing them with new aircraft that have a smaller impact on the environment.
This report tells the story of our ongoing commitment to being a good steward of
the environment, a positive force in the communities we serve, and a great place to
work and fly. Sustainability is driving us forward and will be a key element in Delta¡¯s
continued success.

347,Dominion,3,USA,"This CSR provides detailed narratives and performance metrics
to help our stakeholders understand who we are, what we
believe and how we have performed in such areas as safety,
customer service, community outreach and carbon intensity.
Our company¡¯s commitment to operate responsibly is
rooted in Dominion¡¯s four core values ? safety, ethical
behavior, excellence and teamwork. These four guiding
principles help focus our efforts to address the company¡¯s
leading sustainability challenge: meeting our customers¡¯
growing energy needs while managing and minimizing the
environmental impacts of energy production, transportation
and storage.
Some of the highlights of our 2014 economic, social and
environmental performance include the following:
? We contributed more than $18 million in charitable
donations to about 1,300 nonprofit organizations in the
regions we serve, and Dominion employees contributed
more than 100,000 hours of volunteer service to their
communities ? building bonds and being good neighbors in
countless ways.
? We continued to move forward with the largest electric
and natural gas infrastructure build-out in company history
? a multi-year, $19 billion investment that will serve our
customers for decades ? creating jobs, tax revenues and
economic opportunities for local communities.
? We placed into service more than 200 megawatts of solar
energy in California and Tennessee. Solar power is the
fastest growing renewable energy source in our generating
portfolio. We expect to bring an additional 200 megawatts
of long-term contracted solar capacity online in 2015,
with plans to develop up to 400 megawatts of utility solar generation in Virginia by 2020 ? enough power to supply
100,000 households.
? Total shareholder return, including dividends paid,
increased by 23 percent, well above either the Dow Jones
Industrial Average or the S&P 500 Index.We hired 111 military veterans through our Troops to
Energy Jobs program ? 15 percent of all new hires ? to
support their transition to civilian careers and address
the company¡¯s need for skilled workers.
? We continued to demonstrate responsible environmental
stewardship by reducing atmospheric emissions, including
carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury; by cutting
the amount of electricity used in our office buildings; and
by withdrawing less water from lakes and streams and
recycling more of what we used in our operations.
? We were named ¡°Utility of the Year¡± by Electric Light &
Power, a leading trade publication, for our outstanding
safety performance, corporate reputation, infrastructure
investments, and environmental and sustainability
initiatives.
Behind these and many other accomplishments are a diverse
and dedicated team of Dominion employees. Going forward, we
will continue to challenge ourselves, raise the bar and do even
more to generate sustainable outcomes in all areas of
our business that benefit our customers and the communities
we serve.
I invite you to read our full CSR online and to give us your
feedback at sustainability@dom.com. And thank you for your
interest in Dominion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
348,Dow Chemical,1,USA,"DuPont delivered strong results in 2013, as we continued to execute the strategy that is generating solid returns for our shareholders. Since 2008, we have delivered a total shareholder return of 214 percent, nearly double that of the S&P 500.  In short, our strategy is working.

This past year, the power of our science and R&D, our solid customer relationships, and our emphasis on disciplined execution enabled us to overcome the decline in our Performance Chemicals operating earnings, an uneven global economy, and soft industrial demand. We grew revenue and operating earnings by 3 percent each1.

Aside from the 45 percent market-driven decline in earnings from the Performance Chemicals segment, our businesses grew their segment operating earnings by 11 percent1. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow2 for shareholders, after reinvesting $2.2 billion in research and development and $1.9 billion in capital expenditures for our businesses' future growth. And we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Looking ahead to 2014, we are encouraged by both global macro trends and the significant momentum we generated over the past five years. During the coming year, we will continue to deliver greater value for shareholders through an intense focus on our strategic priorities:
?Agriculture & Nutrition:  Extend our leadership position across the high-value, science-driven segments of the agriculture-to-food value chains.
?Industrial Biosciences: Build transformational new businesses, based on our world-leading biotechnology capabilities.
?Advanced Materials: Strengthen and grow our leading position in differentiated, high-value materials businesses by leveraging new technologies.

We have been refining and enhancing our portfolio around these priorities, always guided by a determination of where our science can give us a competitive edge. We¡¯ve made acquisitions that provide us with added scientific expertise and access to new markets, including Danisco and Pannar Seed. Meanwhile, our divestitures have focused on where we could not use our science to create new growth trajectories, including Performance Coatings, Liquid Packaging Systems, and Zenite¢ç liquid crystal polymer resins. The same logic was behind the recent decision to separate Performance Chemicals, and the announced divestiture of Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls.

Focus on Excellence in Execution Drives Value

Our focus on excellence in execution and the disciplined allocation of capital has allowed us to concentrate our resources on growth opportunities, enhancing value for shareholders. In 2014, we will continue to emphasize our three operational priorities:
?Innovation: Maximize the value of our growth engine, by focusing R&D on businesses that have a proven track record of generating faster growth and higher cash returns. 
?Global Reach: Leverage our presence in more than 90 countries, to drive further penetration in fast-growing developing markets.
?Execution: Deliver ongoing productivity gains that will allow us to further shift resources to higher-growth businesses and improve return on capital, while continuing our strong tradition of returning cash to shareholders.

Our focus on disciplined allocation of capital has led us to concentrate our R&D investment on select opportunities, where we see the potential for superior value creation. Our Agriculture segment is a good illustration. Over the last five years, we increased Agriculture R&D investments and, in turn, we increased our North American corn market share by 7 percentage points, and our soybean market share by more than 10 percentage points over the same period.

DuPont is putting its science and innovation capabilities to work across the globe, advancing our penetration into fast-growing markets, such as Brazil, Ukraine, India and the ASEAN region. These developing markets have been, and will continue to be sources of profitable growth, as we leverage our localized infrastructure across our businesses, collaborate with new, fast-growing customers, and aim our expertise directly at opportunities specific to their needs. Last year, our volume growth in developing markets was 11 percent.

Rigorous attention to how we allocate capital has enabled us to increase DuPont¡¯s return on invested capital (ROIC) by 152 basis points over the last five years, enabling us to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases than the average of the S&P 500 or our peer group of companies.

In January 2014, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase program, and we intend to complete $2 billion of the program in 2014, underscoring our commitment to balance the objectives of maintaining our financial strength, reinvesting in our science-based businesses for growth, and delivering attractive cash returns to our shareholders.

Market-Driven Science and Disciplined Investment

As the global population is projected to increase from 7 to 9 billion by 2050, there are abundant opportunities for science to make a difference in feeding people, developing renewable energy sources, protecting the environment, and creating advanced materials for an increasingly urban world. As a market-driven science company, DuPont is well-positioned to provide solutions to these global challenges.

What makes DuPont unique is our ability to apply our set of 32 core technologies from biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering, to help customers solve their problems and achieve their objectives. Our innovation engine generated sales of more than $10 billion from new products commercialized between 2010 and 2013. In 2013, we introduced nearly 1,800 new products, were granted about 1,050 new U.S. patents, and filed applications for another nearly 1,800 U.S. patents ? all tangible measures of our ability to translate our scientific leadership into marketable products.

Today, our resources, talent and expertise are deployed to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities created by global population trends and economic development. Innovation, global penetration, efficient execution and our ongoing portfolio review will enable us to accelerate the achievement of our long-term growth targets, while delivering near-term value to investors.

With our strategic and operational priorities in place, we will further build on our strong foundation of ¡°Committed to Zero¡± for all our Core Values, and on our science capabilities to deliver innovative, sustainable solutions to our customers, and greater value to our shareholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not just the products we create; it¡¯s the problems we help solve. We are at the forefront of
innovation, technology and science, which puts us in a unique position to apply our science to
help solve the problems facing the planet today, including energy, climate change, water, food,
housing and health ? all through the power of innovation.
Dow is now more than two decades into our sustainability journey, and we continue to raise
the bar not just for ourselves, but also for our industry and the global business community.
We have reduced the ¡°footprint¡± of our operations; we have focused on the ¡°handprint¡± of
our products ? that is, their impact on global sustainability; and we have courageously
collaborated with others, from our work on natural capital with The Nature Conservancy
to the 45,000 homes we have built with Habitat for Humanity.
Last year, we successfully closed out our 2015 Sustainability Goals and renewed our
commitment to sustainability with the launch of our 2025 Sustainability Goals ? our third set
of 10-year goals. In this report, you will discover our progress so far within our own operations

of the United Nations Global Compact. You will also see how we will redefine the role of
business in society by using science and technology to drive sustainability excellence and lead
a ¡°blueprint¡± for a sustainable planet and society.
Even with two historic transactions underway, as we welcome Dow Corning fully to the Dow
family, and merge with DuPont, both of which will revolutionize our industry, we will remain
solidly focused on applying the sciences to make the world a better place. We will deliver
against our 2025 Sustainability Goals and continue to grow value through innovation. We
will set an even higher bar for social and environmental progress by pursuing game-changing
collaborations and engaging in significant dialogues across the public and private sectors.
As leaders in chemistry and innovation, we are privileged to have the opportunity to influence
the future of the planet. Advancing the well-being of humanity is not just our vision for
sustainability; it is our chosen path for success. We look forward to a world in 2025 where

352,DTE Energy,3,USA,"DTE Energy¡¯s Aspiration is to be the best-operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities where we live and serve. This statement isn¡¯t an empty catchphrase like so many that litter cubicles across corporate America. It grew out of our employees¡¯ genuine desire to help build a better future for Michigan and its communities. It arose out of the economic crisis of 2009-2010, when we looked outward and saw a still struggling region. Our employees asked: what can we do to help? Our answer to them: become a best-operated company that provides our customers with excellent service, and use our economic scale to help our communities grow and prosper. Our Aspiration can only be realized through the exceptional energy of our 10,000 employees. To create a great company, our employees must be fully engaged and bring their best energy and focus to work every day. We measure engagement using the Gallup employee engagement survey, and I am very proud of our improvement over the last seven years. In 2014, we earned our third consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award ? the only utility to ever win this award, much less three years in a row. An engaged workforce also is tightly linked to our customer satisfaction. In February 2015, we were recognized in J.D. Power¡¯s rankings as ¡°Highest in Customer Satisfaction With Business Natural Gas Service in the Midwest.¡± Our residential gas business and our electric utility also continue to rank at or near the top in J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys. While we take pride in the progress made in improving our customer service performance, our work is not done. For homeowners and for our communities, we continue to make additional improvements. One of the most important strategic issues for DTE is the coming fundamental transformation of electric power production in Michigan and across the country. We are working closely with policymakers to ensure Michigan is well-positioned for its future energy needs, and I am proud to be part of the utility team steering this effort nationally. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency¡¯s Clean Power Plan has important implications for the communities where power plants have operated for decades and for our customers. We absolutely agree it is time to move toward a cleaner, greener generation mix; however, the path to achieving those goals must also support both a thriving business climate in Michigan and the needs of low income customers. Wind energy is a great resource in Michigan and will play a significant role in this power sector transformation. We recognize that it can also raise concerns. One community in northern Huron County, where wind resources are very high quality, voted to put a moratorium on further wind development. We will need to work closely with local communities to balance their valid concerns with the state¡¯s need for renewable energy sources. Being a leading corporate citizen also means giving back to the communities where we live and serve. 2014 was an extraordinary year in the history of Detroit and our region, as we took the first steps toward a much brighter future. So in that light, DTE Energy and the DTE Energy Foundation provided by far the highest level of giving in our company¡¯s history: $27 million. The Foundation invested $12 million in organizations across Michigan and $5 million in the ¡°Grand Bargain¡± to support the Detroit Institute of Arts and the City of Detroit. We also donated $10 million to The Heat and Warmth Fund and the United Way to expand funding support for our low-income customers. DTE¡¯s purchasing power is yet another way we contribute to the health of our communities. We are one of the leaders of an initiative launched in 2011 to buy more goods and services from Michigan suppliers. We exceeded our initial goal to shift $1 billion to Michigan-based suppliers, and building on that success, I am pleased to share that we recently committed to invest another $5 billion in spending with Michigan-based companies over the next five years. While this report is a chance for us to share our successes with you, it must be balanced with a fair discussion of our challenges. Electric reliability is not where it needs to be, and many of the problems stem from high winds that bring down trees and tree branches onto our power lines. We are investing heavily in tree trimming near our lines, but we haven¡¯t always done a good job of communicating how and why we are doing that. We appreciate the beauty and value trees bring to our customers and communities, and are using the feedback we have received from customers to upgrade our communication and pursue the work in a way that makes sense for everyone. Another challenge for us is our natural gas business, where 30 percent of our customers live below 150 percent of the poverty line. They struggle to pay bills ? and declining state energy assistance funding levels and recent colder winters haven¡¯t helped. We want to serve our customer base with dignity, but we also can¡¯t provide services without payment. Our highly successful Low Income Self-Sufficiency Plan is one way we have helped, and we are working with the state to establish a more sustainable long-term footing for the program. This 2014-2015 Corporate Citizenship Report provides our stakeholders with an inside look at the work we are focused on for our customers and our communities. It tells the story of our employees and the energy and spirit that drives us each day to best serve our customers, to help our company grow, to be good stewards of the environment and to be proud supporters of our communities.

355,Eastman Chemical,2,USA,"Since the publication of our last report, I am honored to have become Chief Executive Officer of a company that considers sustainability as an essential component of its business. I am convinced that our commitment to sustainability delivers significant benefits to our company and to all of our stakeholders. 
At Eastman, sustainability serves as a lens for how we do business and encompasses the triple bottom line ? environment, social and economic. Not only does sustainability influence the way we think; it determines the way we act. Without a doubt, our approach to sustainability is crucial to the future success and growth  of Eastman.
Sustainability is about creating innovative products that help make the world a better place while driving improved cost and energy efficiencies throughout our operations. Sustainability is also about providing a fulfilling place for our employees to work and nurturing positive relationships with people in the local communities wherever we are in the world. Quite simply, we view sustainability as both ¡°good business¡± and the right thing to do.
Eastman¡¯s growth strategy is focused on innovation. Our customers are increasingly looking for solutions that combine enhanced performance and durability with improved environmental and safety characteristics. We believe Eastman is uniquely positioned to meet these demands.
We have made excellent progress with our development of sustainably advantaged products. The acquisition of Solutia in 2012 expanded our portfolio and deepened our penetration in industries such as transportation and building and construction. Our product innovations range from BPA-free copolyesters and non-phthalate plasticizers to advanced interlayers, additives for tires and performance films. 
A top priority for everyone at Eastman has been improving the energy efficiency of our operations, and we are proud of our results to date. For the third consecutive year, we¡¯ve been recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an 
ENERGY STAR¢ç Partner of the Year, achieving Sustained Excellence in 2014. Eastman is the only chemical company to receive the award more than once, demonstrating our commitment to improving and maintaining the company¡¯s energy performance. 
None of this good work would be possible without the dedication of our team members. I salute their exemplary efforts to continuously look at ways to manufacture better products using fewer raw materials and less energy. The men and women of Eastman are committed to doing the right thing without being told. Our ability to further integrate sustainability into our culture is a direct result of the outstanding work our team members do every day. 
I strongly believe that the chemical industry plays a pivotal role in identifying new sustainable solutions to address global challenges. Eastman¡¯s ability to do that is dependent on our ongoing collaboration with all our valued stakeholders, which is why we¡¯ve titled this year¡¯s report, Moving forward together. 
Although we¡¯ve made progress, there is always  room for improvement. We have continued work  to do. We are up for the challenge, and we¡¯re eager  to embrace new opportunities that will continue  to emerge as the needs of the world evolve.

Our environmental commitments are consistent with the company¡¯s dedication to not only maintain an excellent compliance record but to identify, develop, and invest in new technologies and practices that take us beyond basic environmental standards. We continually look for opportunities to minimize our environmental footprint by conserving natural resources, inventing more efficient production methods and developing chemistries that use renewable raw materials. Collaboration-driven innovation Truly innovative companies understand the needs, drivers and behaviors across the value chain down to the end consumer ? even when consumers themselves do not yet realize their unmet or future needs. Doing this requires strategic thought and collaboration. We monitor ever-evolving macro trends and their associated demand effects while also using our insights to deliver solutions to our customers, downstream retailers and consumers. Sustainability is a lens for innovation. Impactful partnerships
We look to maximize collective impact by collaborating with and engaging partners, both public and private, with a strategic focus to generate positive change in the communities where we operate and beyond. I often say, ¡°Small hinges swing big doors.¡± A small act can make a huge difference. In this report, you will see examples of our work with world-class partners that will yield meaningful results. I¡¯m honored to serve as the steward of sustainability at Eastman, and I invite you to join us on this journey.

368,Exelon,1,USA,"In March, we celebrated the one year anniversary of our merger with Constellation Energy, a
transformational merger that brought together two companies long committed to the common goal of
becoming the nation¡¯s leading provider of safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy to its customers.
Our first year together proves the durability and potential of our sustainable business strategy. Today,
Exelon is the leading competitive energy company in the U.S., with coast-to-coast operations in 47
states. Exelon owns and operates a diverse mix of clean generation resources in 18 states and proudly
serves 6.6 million customers through our three metropolitan utilities, Baltimore Gas and Electric,
Commonwealth Edison and PECO Energy. The merger has allowed us to harness the advantages of
our size, scope and scale to invest in cleaner energy; promote well-functioning competitive markets
that drive affordable energy; develop an engaged, diverse and high-performing workforce; contribute
to our communities¡¯ well-being; and strengthen our economic position.
With one of the nation¡¯s largest fleets of clean generating assets and one of its largest customer
bases, Exelon has made steady and significant progress toward a sustainable energy future. We have
already achieved 89 percent of our ambitious legacy Exelon 2020 greenhouse gas abatement goal.
The scope and flexibility of our business model positions us well to continue that progress, even in the
face of shifting economic conditions. Our utilities have become recognized leaders in energy efficiency
and smart grid deployment. Through the start of 2013, we have invested more than $690M in smart
technologies that improve the efficiency and reliability of the delivery system, while reducing operating
costs and GHG emissions. The utilities will continue to make additional investments of approximately
$2 billion as we roll out these new technologies through the balance of the decade. These projects
support good jobs in our communities and provide shareholders with sustainable and attractive returns.
Our growth investments in 2012 have paid off for the environment and our investors. We added nearly
500 MW of new, clean generating capacity in 2012: 404 MW in new wind power projects, 31 MW in new
solar at our Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One project, and 63 MW in nuclear power uprates. We will add
approximately 200 MW of solar to our portfolio in 2013 through continued development at Antelope
Valley Solar Ranch One. Exelon will also continue to pursue license renewals for our valuable nuclear
and hydroelectric assetsIn pursuing all of these investments, Exelon remains committed to competitive markets and
customer choice. We believe that the engine of competition will best drive technology innovation
and investment in clean and affordable energy. These markets give customers the right to choose
the electricity suppliers that best meet their needs and enable them to participate in new energy
efficiency and demand response programs that could not have been envisioned in the old system
of generation monopolies.
Exelon will continue to advocate for competitive markets and against policies that unintentionally
may do harm to these markets. In this regard, we have been clear that government subsidies that
pick winners and losers undermine the efficient allocation of capital and ultimately discourage market
investments. Government very clearly has a critical role in setting forth GHG abatement goals, but it
must stop short of telling industry how to accomplish these goals. Consumers and the environment
will win if companies and generation technologies are required to compete on a best price basis for a
clean and affordable energy future.
Exelon shares its stakeholders¡¯ concerns over the stubborn economic conditions that continue to
vex the economy. Cost management remains a priority. We have reordered capital plans to manage
cash and protect our credit metrics, giving ourselves the flexibility and balance sheet strength to
invest in growth. And we have aligned the dividend policy with our business model and financial
priorities, which will improve our ability to provide shareholder value through sustainable dividends
and earnings growth.
Operational excellence is central to how we practice sustainability day-to-day, and it begins with a
relentless focus on safety. No discussion of sustainability is complete without including our people
? our employees drive excellence. Diverse and inclusive teams bring perspectives that allow us to
enhance and innovate, whether we are helping to achieve industry-leading capacity factors at our
nuclear power plants, installing new technologies to modernize the electric grid, or developing our
workforce. Exelon is committed to investing in our employees, for today and tomorrow. Exelon¡¯s values are also clearly demonstrated in our community stewardship. In addition to the
company providing nearly $28M in grants across our service territories in 2012, our committed
employees gave back to the communities where they live and work. Exelon employees last year
volunteered more than 100,000 hours to support 823 community projects and pledged $6.5M
to United Way organizations. We understand the importance of both corporate and employee
engagement in the community, and are proud of the accomplishments described in this report.
As part of our vision for the future of the company, we firmly believe that being a clean generator and
having the capability to deliver innovative solutions for our customers will be essential for sustaining
our competitive advantage. While there is uncertainty around the challenges and opportunities that
the next half-century will bring, we believe we will be well positioned to create value as we address
issues including climate change, customer expectations, technological innovation and public policy.
We hope this sustainability report provides further insight into our strategy for sustaining progress,
our performance, and how we are balancing economic, environmental and social considerations in our
business decisions and public policy positions. Exelon is providing better service, cleaner energy and
greater choice to its customers than ever before. We are proud of this company and confident we are
taking the right steps to create a more sustainable future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
585,Exelon,4,USA,"At its core, Exelon¡¯s business and sustainability strategy focuses on creating value for our customers. Value for our shareholders will follow. During 2015, Exelon continued evolving our business plans based on our assessment of the major trends impacting our industry, and our views on the most promising opportunities in terms of future capital investment and product and service offerings. Our industry continues to be transformed by low-cost natural gas, technological innovations, the rapid expansion of renewables, energy storage, local generation resources and initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. All of this is combined with customers¡¯ changing expectations for how they buy and use energy. As part of our annual strategic planning process, Exelon and our Board of Directors in 2015 assessed these market, technological and customer forces, and sharpened our long-term value strategy. We are investing in our core businesses, while also embracing emerging technology and innovations that represent the future of energy. Technology development and deployment are accelerating rapidly, both at regulated utilities and in competitive markets. Further, consumer interest in decentralized technologies, such as local, distributed energy and energy storage, as well as technologies to manage energy use in homes and businesses is growing. We also see public interest in more sustainable energy production, distribution and energy use solutions, particularly with regard to climate change, water resource availability and energy efficiency. We are partnering with our customers to help them benefit from the emerging integrated smart power grid. As part of our strategy, we continue to take steps to support a culture of innovation and technology competence among our employees. Exelon¡¯s innovation initiatives continue to harness the enthusiasm of our workforce and offer promising business opportunities. We are deploying several new technologies that will improve operational performance, safety and efficiency. For example, the ¡°digital worker¡± will take advantage of wearable technologies, biometrics and expanded mobile apps, among other components. Advanced analytics will optimize asset performance and predictive maintenance. We are systematically building a more innovative culture, and we¡¯re seeing real business results. In addition to improving our internal operations through technology and innovation, we are making major capital investments in our systems that will benefit our customers. During 2015 at our legacy utilities ? BGE, ComEd and PECO ? we invested $3.7 billion to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. These utility investments will continue, with an estimated additional $18 billion to be invested from 2016 to 2020. As described throughout this report, these investments are yielding significant customer, economic and environmental benefits. I am proud that Exelon¡¯s utilities are among the leaders in the nation in deploying smart meter technologies that enable two-way communication between customer meters and Exelon utilities. At completion, we will have installed almost 7.2 million electric and almost 1.2 million gas meters at legacy Exelon utility customer locations. Smart meter technologies offer many benefits, including more efficient storm restoration response, realtime energy use management by homes and businesses, and opportunities to more precisely manage circuit voltages, reducing lost energy and avoiding greenhouse gas and other emissions in the process. I am pleased to report that our merger with Pepco Holdings closed on March 23, 2016, joining Exelon¡¯s top-performing legacy utilities and Pepco Holdings¡¯ electric and gas utilities ? Atlantic City Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco ? to create the leading mid-Atlantic electric and gas utility company. The merger provides significant customer benefits, including specific commitments to reduce the frequency and duration of outages and funding for rate credits, energy efficiency, low-income assistance and clean energy. Operationally, the merger provides for greater economies of scale, the sharing of best practices and coordination of resources. In addition to the legacy Exelon utilities¡¯ investments in infrastructure, Pepco Holdings plans to spend almost $1.4 billion in capital across its three utilities in 2016, with a total spend of almost $7 billion over the next five years. At Exelon Generation in 2015, we evolved our investment strategy to increase renewable generation with long-term contracts, completing construction of 108 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity at Fair Wind (Maryland) and Sendero (Texas), increasing our wind portfolio to more than 1,500 MW. For 2016, we plan to construct additional wind energy facilities in Michigan and Oklahoma, with a total generating capacity of 350 MW. Other renewable energy investments in 2015 included 56 MW of new solar generation, bringing the Exelon solar portfolio to more than 468 MW, as well as investment in biogas and biomass plants. In terms of conventional generation, we completed a 272-MW uprate at the Peach Bottom nuclear plant, a new 120-MW gas-fired unit at our Perryman station, and we continued construction of two new combined cycle gas plants in Texas, totaling almost 2,200 MW of capacity. As air-cooled plants, these units will have significantly reduced consumptive water use requirements, helping to meet Texas¡¯ energy needs in a manner that is responsive to the state¡¯s longterm water availability concerns. The plants are also designed for very rapid response to changing supply and demand dynamics, supporting better integration of new variable wind resources into the system. Operational excellence remains foundational to Exelon¡¯s business strategy and competitive position. I am pleased to report that in 2015 Exelon¡¯s utilities and generation assets had very good operating years. Our utilities turned in first quartile SAIFI and CAIDI reliability performance. Customer satisfaction was also first quartile, with BGE and ComEd experiencing their best-ever customer satisfaction scores. At Exelon Generation, Nuclear continued to perform at world-class levels with a 93.7 percent capacity factor, demonstrating the value of nuclear power as an ¡°always-on¡± and highly reliable generation resource under all weather and system operation scenarios. At Exelon Power, power dispatch match was 98.6 percent and renewable energy capture was 95.5 percent. As a company with operations across the energy value chain, Exelon is subject to many market, reliability and environmental regulatory regimes. During 2015, we worked with our regulated utility stakeholders to envision the energy provider of the future and to seek solutions to ensure the continued availability of a reliable, resilient and adequately funded integrated power grid. In the generation space, we promoted solutions to ensure a level playing field for our clean, reliable generation resources in competitive markets through environmental regulations that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. We maintained our relentless focus on safety performance in 2015, with Exelon Power achieving zero employee OSHA recordable incidents, its best safety performance ever. Thousands of Exelon employees participated in training and development opportunities, and almost 1,400 employees participated in our annual Innovation Expo. Exelon¡¯s commitment to community service remained in high gear in 2015. Employee charitable giving increased 12 percent over the prior year, and employees volunteered nearly 130,000 hours in community service. Exelon, our operating units and the Exelon Foundation contributed more than $36 million to nonprofit partners, focusing on making the arts accessible, innovative STEM education programs, preserving the environment, diversity and inclusion, and improving the health of the communities we serve. I am proud of what Exelon and our employees delivered in 2015 ? excellent operational safety and reliability, innovative customer-focused energy solutions, sustainable investments and competitively priced products. We will continue to deliver on these commitments in 2016. ¡°I am pleased to report that our merger with Pepco Holdings closed on March 23, 2016, joining Exelon¡¯s top-performing legacy utilities and Pepco Holdings¡¯ electric and gas utilities ?

371,ExxonMobil,2,USA,"Welcome to the 2013 Corporate Citizenship Report. This report is an opportunity to reaffirm the commitments we make to our shareholders, employees, customers and communities regarding our corporate citizenship performance. We strive to be responsible corporate citizens, and our success along that path is underpinned by our technological expertise, operational excellence, safety performance and unwavering ethical standards.
Modern society consumes energy on a much wider and more complex scale than ever before. Over the coming decades, the world¡¯s population is projected to rise from 7 billion to nearly 9 billion, and the global economy will more than double. As energy needs evolve, ExxonMobil will continue investing in the research and technology necessary to find, develop and deliver energy resources to our customers in the most efficient way possible. Working together with our stakeholders, we can help shape the landscape of energy consumption in the future.
ECOnOMiC GROWTh Access to energy is crucial to economic prosperity and human progress. in developing countries, it is fundamental to reducing poverty, improving health, increasing productivity, enhancing competitiveness and promoting long-term economic growth. improving access to reliable and affordable energy in order to sustain and improve standards of living is the biggest and most impactful contribution we make to local communities and economies. But, our responsibility to society does not end there.
Wherever we do business, we look to establish a skilled local workforce through aggressive recruitment and world-class training and development programs. We continued to make significant progress in hiring host country workers in 2013. For example, in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, indonesia and nigeria, we have established a national workforce that on average accounts for 83 percent of our workers. We also develop the capacity of and utilize local vendors to supply ExxonMobil with goods and services. Our goal is to help local communities and businesses fuel their economies and positively contribute to long-term economic growth for generations to come. 
COMMiTMEnT TO SAFETy At ExxonMobil, our Operations Integrity Management System establishes common expectations for addressing safety, security, health, environmental and social risks. Our goal that Nobody Gets Hurt is more than just three words; it is a core value that drives us to be a successful business, a responsible employer and a good neighbor. in 2013, ExxonMobil was honored with the Green Cross for Safety¢ç medal. Established in 2000, the U.S. national Safety Council awards the medal to an organization that exhibits safety leadership at all levels, boasts an outstanding safety record and is committed to improving the quality of life in the communities where its employees work and live.
The commitment of our nearly 75,000 employees, as well as our third-party contractors, helped ExxonMobil continue to be among the industry leaders again in 2013. 
Compared with 2012, our workforce lost-time incident rate decreased by nearly 9 percent. Since the inclusion of XTO Energy in 2011, we have reduced our workforce lost-time incident rate by 45 percent. The unwavering dedication of every worker allows for continual improvement ? a goal always at the forefront of our safety culture.
EnViROnMEnTAl PERFORMAnCE Careful management of our environmental performance, through a focus on operational excellence, is an essential responsibility for our business. Our Operations Integrity Management System helps us align our environmental priorities with our business objectives and allows us to find new areas of opportunity to reduce environmental incidents.
Spill prevention is a core component of ExxonMobil¡¯s environmental performance. We continually seek to develop and improve risk management, operations integrity, spill prevention processes and containment capabilities, and, as a result, we had fewer spills in 2013 compared with 2012.

374,FedEx,1,USA,"At FedEx, we¡¯ve seen the great results of connecting people and possibilities around the world, and we realize the success of communities and companies are intertwined. That¡¯s why we put such emphasis on the social responsibility connection. Through it we can drive positive change in our cities, marketplaces, and society at large. Plus, it¡¯s good business and a wise investment in the future of FedEx.We also see social responsibility as an engine of innovation. Working toward greater sustainability and citizenship has led us to develop myriad new programs and processes that deliver greater opportunities for our customers, our communities, and our planet. Innovation in social responsibility is also a way to inspire our team to think ¡°glocally¡± and ignite big ideas into smaller, local applications.
ENERGY INNOVATION
As a big consumer of oil, FedEx committed years ago to monitor our footprint across the industry and the globe. We continue to focus on alternative transport fuel sources such as electricity, natural gas, and biofuels.
Through the Energy Security Leadership Council (ESLC), we¡¯ve worked with business and military leaders to effect energy legislation in both the Obama and Bush administrations. Through FedEx advocacy, we supported new fuelefficiency standards for commercial vehicles. We¡®ve advocated new aviation technologies that improve safety and reduce fuel consumption. We¡¯ve worked to develop new national policies for highway investments to reduce congestion and save energy. 
At the same time, we¡¯ve committed to a lighter environmental footprint. In 2008, we set a goal of improving the overall fuel efficiency of the FedEx Express vehicle fleet 20% by 2020. Now, less than five years later, FedEx Express has surpassed that goal. So we¡¯re upping the ante and are now targeting a 30% improvement in fuel efficiency for our global express vehicle fleet by 2020, based on a 2005 baseline. This echoes last year¡¯s announcement to raise our aircraft emissions intensity goal from a 20% to a 30% reduction in emissions intensity by 2020.
GRASSROOTS SAVVY
While we are proud of the broad changes we have kindled as a company, we realize our sustainability efforts don¡¯t just come from the top of the organization. We have plenty of grassroots champions. Some 300,000 FedEx team members around the world are often a creative impetus for our problem-solving through their diverse outlooks and great ideas.
For example, a FedEx team in Brazil had been recycling for years but decided to expand their impact by donating their recyclables to nonprofit organizations. One of those nonprofits helped disadvantaged mothers turn recycled materials into stylish bags that brought income to their families. Other Brazilian team members worked with a university biofuel program to reuse motor and cooking oil. To date, they¡¯ve recycled nearly 4,000 liters of oil to help power more than 28 tractors and heavy vehicles.
In addition, we cultivate entrepreneurs who strive toward sustainability. For the first time, we awarded small-business grants totaling $50,000 to six small businesses. Darn Good Yarn in Maine received one of those grants due to their production of yarn made from remnants of silk saris. These materials are handspun and dyed by women in India and Nepal, who receive wages for their work and a marketplace for their goods: proof once again that social responsibility can lead to global growth and local success.From an advocacy standpoint, we will champion more research on vehicle batteries and practical applications of natural gas for transportation. We¡¯ll recommend more streamlined permitting processes for major energy projects. And we¡¯ll urge additional funding for the development of advanced biofuels. In fact, FedEx will be collaborating with The Nature Conservancy to help create a biofuels roadmap for the long-distance road transport sector.
We will continue collaborating with sectors such as utilities, manufacturing, transportation, academia, and government to expand the range of all-electric vehicles and produce cost-effective biofuels. As always, FedEx will put safety above all other considerations in transportation innovations.
As you read the 2012 Global Citizenship Report, you¡¯ll see that it takes a broader, more data-driven approach. We¡¯re adding metrics recognized globally as important indications of a company¡¯s commitment to social responsibility. These metrics align with the Global Reporting Initiative G3.1 Guidelines for more standardized and transparent reporting.
I encourage you to read the stories in this report: the people-to-people connections they describe will surely surprise and inspire you. They also reflect the commitment of our entire FedEx team to higher standards of global citizenship and to delivering more possibilities for people everywhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
587,FedEx,4,USA,"WHAT CONNECTS US MAKES US STRONGER. Few companies have the privilege of participating in the world at large like we do at FedEx. From holiday e-commerce packages to global supply chain solutions to disaster relief, we¡¯re fortunate to be part of millions of lives and thousands of communities. ""Without question, we realize the interests of our communities, our workplaces, and the planet are intertwined. Our future depends on recognizing and balancing those needs in everything we do across our business."" From our vantage point, we see firsthand how the world works. Without question, we realize the interests of our communities, our workplaces, and the planet are intertwined. Our future depends on recognizing and balancing those needs in everything we do across our business. This is equally important to our customers, investors, and team members. In fact, $6.7 billion in FY16 revenue came from customers who wanted to know more about the emissions generated from shipping their goods. Commerce adds jobs to communities Our business-to-business, business-toconsumer, and e-commerce solutions benefit more customers than ever, helping them to prosper and their communities to flourish. Today, just about anyone with a mobile phone can reach new markets almost instantly. At FedEx, our services physically connect customers to the digital economy, creating more jobs and improving lives. Here¡¯s an example from the brother-andsister team that founded ArtLifting three years ago. Through e-commerce propelled by FedEx, the small Boston business sells paintings and prints from more than 100 homeless and disabled artists to buyers throughout the U.S. and around the world. These artists receive more than half the sales from their works, not to mention a big boost in pride and confidence. It¡¯s a brilliant business strategy that also betters the lives of underserved people. Stories like this demonstrate the power of trade to create new markets and greater opportunities. In fact, 7 in 10 U.S. small businesses see global trade as improving the U.S. economy, according to the FedEx Trade Index, a 2016 survey conducted by Morning Consult. Trade is our business, and we¡¯re proud that FedEx jobs are trade jobs. Of course, we¡¯re not unique ? about 40 million jobs in the U.S. are directly related to trade. Sustainability reduces our environmental footprint As trade connects the world and enhances prosperity, we understand that how we connect the world matters. By incorporating sustainability efforts throughout our global network, we¡¯re reducing the environmental footprint of commerce. Since 2008, we¡¯ve saved more than 158 million gallons of vehicle fuel by replacing vehicles with more efficient models and making greater use of electric vehicles, fuel cells, natural gas, hybrids and clean truck technologies. In FY15, five years ahead of target, we met our goal of increasing FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency by 30 percent from a 2005 baseline. We¡¯ve now set a new goal. By 2025, we want to increase vehicle fuel efficiency by 50 percent from a 2005 baseline, or 17 percent from a 2015 baseline. In FY16, we saved more than 153 million gallons of jet fuel by continuing to modernize our aviation fleet and improve operations. As a result, we avoided the equivalent of almost 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Safety makes our communities better places to live At the same time we set and meet our sustainability goals, we are focused on safety ? our No. 1 priority. Ensuring the safety of the people in our global network ? along with our customers and communities ? is a complex job. But it¡¯s one we take extremely seriously. Like sustainability, we integrate safety into everything we do, and we share our safety expertise with communities around the world. In cities from Mexico City to Mumbai, we¡¯re working with EMBARQ, part of the World Resources Institute¡¯s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, to develop safe and sustainable transport and planning solutions. EMBARQ adapted the FedEx Safety First manual to train 1,150 public transportation drivers in three Mexico cities. As a result of the training, more than 1.2 million passengers a day benefit from safer bus systems. The FedEx team shares expertise to change lives Our community investment strategy is simple: We do what we do best for those in need. That includes sharing our knowledge and resources in collaboration ""Today, just about anyone with a mobile phone can reach new markets almost instantly. At FedEx, our services physically connect customers to the digital economy, creating more jobs and improving lives."" with trusted non-governmental and non-profit organizations to tackle some of society¡¯s biggest problems in communities where we live and work. In FY16, the first year of our commitment to invest $200 million in more than 200 global communities by 2020, we invested more than $46 million in charitable contributions, benefiting 97 communities around the world. Team members came out in force, contributing more than $9 million during our United Way campaign, Frederick W. Smith Chairman and CEO and volunteering more than 93,000 hours in more than 500 cities worldwide.

Engineering, procurement, construction, fabri- cation, maintenance and project management ? these are the words that describe the work we do at Fluor. But our work extends far beyond this simple definition. Our employees work with governments and the leading corporations of vital industries to build the world¡¯s largest and

most technically challenging projects ? projects that fuel global commerce, stimulate economic development and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the world.

In executing large, complex projects for our clients, we gain a unique perspective of the opportunities created by growth and develop- ment, as well as the economic, environmental and social issues that arise. We gain firsthand experience of the interdependencies that exist and the crucial need for collaboration between diverse stakeholders. Fluor¡¯s sustainability practices are built on this understanding and deeply ingrained in the way we do business.

In 2013, we upgraded Fluor systems to better manage our sustainability performance. We began widespread tracking of specific measures related to energy, water, waste, material use and community support so that we can better analyze and improve our economic, environmental and social performance. We also began implemen- tation of a comprehensive talent management system to improve project staffing, identify skills gaps and provide development opportunities for employees that support our business strategies.

Fluor is committed to continually improving our sustainability practices and performance, as it benefits our stakeholders and our business.

We bring Fluor sustainability expertise to every project we undertake. From safe work practices, energy efficiency and carbon management to

anti-corruption practices and community involvement, we have established processes and best practices to guide project implementation. The Fluor Sustainability Manual, now in its fifth year of imple- mentation in Fluor offices and projects, documents our global sustainability prac- tices and enables our clients to make informed decisions.

We also use our engineering and construction expertise to help drive sustainable devel- opment for Fluor¡¯s clients. In 2013, we extended our services in the renewable, nuclear and clean energy markets. Fluor was awarded its first solar photovoltaic operations and maintenance contract in Arizona. NuScale Power, a small modular nuclear reactor technology company in which we have invested, received approval for U.S. Department of Energy funding that will support its development, licensing and commercialization. And we were commissioned to design and construct a clean fuels project in Kuwait. Fluor has the experience and expertise to help our clients succeed in a world where sustainable development increasingly is the standard for doing business.

Fluor¡¯s 2013 Sustainability Report ? Beyond the Blueprint ? details our economic, environmental and social commitments and captures Fluor¡¯s rela- tionship with the world. Fluor has always looked ¡°beyond the blueprint¡± to improve what¡¯s possible. In 2013, we continued this practice by working with our stakeholders to achieve sustainable growth over the long term. I invite you to read our 2013 report and learn more about how Fluor is working to realize the possibilities of global economic growth and development, while managing issues that could impact our stakeholders.

ALIGNMENT WITH GRI G4 GUIDELINES

GRI is an international nonprofit organization that promotes the use of sustainability reporting as a way for organizations to become more sustainable and contribute to sustainable development. GRI provides companies and organizations with a comprehensive sustainability reporting framework that is widely used around the world. G4 is the latest version of GRI¡¯s Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

GRI offers two options for an organization to prepare its sustainability report in accordance with the guidelines: core and comprehensive. According to the GRI, the core option contains the essential elements of a sustainability report and provides the background against which an organization communicates the impacts of its economic, environmental, social and governance performance. The comprehensive option builds on the core option by requiring additional standard disclosures of an organization¡¯s strategy and analysis, governance, ethics and integrity. In addition, the reporting organization is required to communicate its performance more extensively by reporting on all indicators related to identifying material aspects.

381,Ford Motor,3,USA,"It has been 15 years since we published our first report addressing the economic, environmental and social impacts of our products and operations around the world. During that time, throughout a variety of economic conditions, business cycles and social transformations, we have been reporting on the progress of our sustainability efforts.
We¡¯re proud of how we have been transforming our company, from the vehicles we make to the way in which we make them. From water use to human rights to carbon dioxide emissions, we have moved forward and made substantial progress toward a suite of goals and commitments we have set for ourselves.
Between 2000 and 2014, for example, we cut our total global water use by 62 percent, or more than 10 billion gallons, and achieved our original water-reduction goal two years ahead of schedule.
More than 10 years ago, we introduced the world¡¯s first hybrid SUV, and today we remain committed to offering customers the ¡°power of choice¡± for fuel efficiency. In early 2015, we built our 5 millionth EcoBoost -powered gasoline vehicle. Our fuel-saving EcoBoost technology is now available in every region where we operate and offered on more than 80 percent of our global nameplates.
¡°At Ford, mobility is about far more than motion. It is really about progress. Human progress.¡±We also have led our industry in groundbreaking work to reduce environmental impacts, and we were the first automaker to take on the issue of human rights to enhance working conditions in the supply chain.
Our efforts were acknowledged in 2014 when we were named by Interbrand as the Best Global Green Brand in the world ? the number one company not just in the automotive industry but among all types of businesses. Further validation came in 2015 when we were named to the Ethisphere Institute¡¯s list of the World¡¯s Most Ethical Companies for the sixth year in a row, the only automaker to earn the recognition in each of the last six years.
We are honored to receive these recognitions. Nonetheless, we know our sustainability journey is far from over, and we are determined to go further, particularly as our industry is evolving faster than ever before. Our Priorities
As we build on our strong foundation and continue to transform to meet the needs of the future, we are driven by three priorities:
Accelerating our pace of progress on the One Ford plan Delivering product excellence with passion Driving innovation in every part of our business
Ford is a growth company in a growing global industry. The past five years mark one of the most consistently profitable periods in our recent history, and we are poised to accelerate our progress in all areas of our business.
We also are a proven innovator, in a period of swift technological advancement. Already, technology has enabled rapid evolution in our vehicles. However, revolutions in connectivity and technology, as well as the changing needs and desires of our customers, are opening avenues for entirely new ways of thinking about our business. It¡¯s not only about cars and trucks. It¡¯s about helping people and things move seamlessly and efficiently using all available modes of transportation. Ford Smart Mobility
In 2012, we announced our Blueprint for Mobility, which defines our vision for what transportation will look like in 2025 and beyond, and the technologies, business models and partnerships needed to get there. Our plan outlines a future of connected cars that communicate with each other and the world around them to make driving safer, ease traffic congestion and sustain the environment. We already have put in place many of the building blocks of this future.
¡°Growing up, there was something almost heroic about the car. The automobile represented possibility. I think we are there again.¡± autonomous vehicles, the customer experience and big data. We also announced more than 25 mobility experiments around the world to test breakthrough transportation ideas to create better customer experiences, more flexible usership models and social collaboration that can reward customers. You can find more details on the exciting experiments we are conducting, as well as the global megatrends that are driving our thinking, elsewhere in this report.
We¡¯re pursuing Ford Smart Mobility in line with our bedrock conviction that the benefits of breakthrough technologies should be democratized. Our goal is to make connectivity, mobility and autonomous vehicles accessible to millions of people ? not just a select few. Changing the Way the World Moves
Without question, we are embarking on one of the most transformative periods in our history.
We understand that the winners will be the innovators, the disruptors and those willing to break with tradition and find new solutions. That¡¯s why we are pushing ourselves even harder to think, act and disrupt like a startup company.
We are driving to be both a product company and a mobility company. Our vision is nothing less than to change the way the world moves.
At Ford, we view this as the ultimate opportunity. In fact, it is as big of an opportunity as when our founder put the world on wheels more than a century ago. Henry Ford believed that a good business makes excellent products and earns a healthy return. But he proved that a great business does all that while creating a better world.
That is what continues to drive us each day.
Our Blueprint for Sustainability, which focuses on our products and global environmental footprint, brings to life our pledge to build a strong business, deliver great products and create a better world ? and to make this pledge relevant in a future that will be very different from the past.¡±",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
382,Gap,1,USA,"In 2004, Gap Inc. issued our first Social Responsibility report.
We have approached each report in the same way ? a candid, open assessment of our progress as a company and as
a collaborative partner to address the complex issues of operating a global business in a responsible, ethical way.
I am proud of our achievements as a business, and I¡¯m equally proud of how we do business. At Gap Inc., we are
deeply committed to social and environmental responsibility, and to ensuring that each day, we live up to the values
on which the company was founded in 1969. That¡¯s why this report is so meaningful to me and to our company¡¯s
more than 135,000 employees.
In the two years since our last Social & Environmental Responsibility Report, Gap Inc. has made great strides in our
mission to ¡°be the world¡¯s favorite for American style.¡±
Our portfolio of brands now includes Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, Piperlime, and our newest brand,
Intermix. With stores in about 50 countries, we expanded our presence in China, opened Athleta stores throughout
the U.S., launched Old Navy in Japan, its first location outside North America, and introduced Gap to South America.
With each step we take to expand our business, we ensure that our social and environmental policies and our
cultural heritage of community investment and support are integrated into each store and country.
Wherever they¡¯re located, our brands, stores and employees around the world are bound together by our promise, as
voiced by our co-founder, Don Fisher, to ¡°do more than sell clothes.¡±
Our employees embrace our philanthropic heritage by investing their time and contributions in our communities.
In 2012, more than 70,000 employees volunteered about 460,000 hours. Along with a company donation of more
than $1 million in funds and clothing following the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, employees are building Habitat
for Humanity houses for those who lost their homes.
To address social and environmental issues, we¡¯ve strengthened partnerships in the belief that our combined efforts
and resources can lead to comprehensive answers to multifaceted issues. We continue to press for greater accountability
across all industries as a strong supporter of the United Nations Global Compact and its ten guiding principles.
Over the years, we¡¯ve entered and invested in a number of countries and we¡¯re gratified to be part of their success
stories. One example is our partnership with the International Labour Organization Better Work Program to support
vendor compliance with labor standards and laws, which launched in Cambodia in 2004, and has expanded to Haiti,
Indonesia, Jordan, Lesotho, Nicaragua and Vietnam.
In Bangladesh, where recent tragedies underscore a country safety record thatis unacceptable, we are dedicated to
investing the time, effort and funding to bring about lasting change for garment workers. Gap Inc. was one of the
first companies to implement our own four-point fire and safety program in the Bangladesh factories that make our
products. Through a collaborative process, led by former U.S. Senators George Mitchell and Olympia Snowe, Gap Inc.
and leading retailers and apparel companies founded the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, making a commitment
to a binding, five-year fire and safety initiative that provides a $45 million worker safety fund, in addition to the
more than $100 million in access to low-cost capital being offered by some companies in order to ensure that safety
remediation at factories they work with is done in a timely manner. We acknowledge there is more work to be done,
but believe these two initiatives represent an important step forward in helping to achieve sustainable reform in the
country¡¯s garment industry. Our conviction that advancing women advances the world is reflected by the 20,000 female garment workers who
have completed training through the Gap Inc. P.A.C.E. (Personal Advancement, Career Enhancement) program since
2007. By 2015, we¡¯re committed to 10,000 new participants.
As part of our ongoing sustainability strategy, we continue to explore ways to reduce our environmental footprint.
Our Mills Engagement Program, developed in conjunction with the Natural Resources Defense Council, is a
clean-water initiative aimed at establishing standards to mitigate the environmental effects of dyeing and finishing
facilities. After reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 2003 to 2008, we¡¯re taking the next step
by pledging to reduce GHG emissions by another 20 percent, based on our 2008 levels, by 2015.
On this website, we share recent achievements to build upon for the future, areas that need greater attention, and
the tangible goals we are working towards to improve the lives of those who work at and with Gap Inc., and the
communities in which we do business. I invite you to read through our report, and learn, in more detail, about our
social and environmental responsibility efforts.
Thank you for your time and your interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
383,Gap,3,USA,"What that story is, however, can be tough to know at first glance.
Was a shirt or jacket sewn by someone who works in safe and fair conditions? Was care
taken to mitigate any potential environmental harm caused by the manufacturing process?
Were the people whose lives were touched by the creation of a piece of clothing affected
in a positive way?
I¡¯m convinced that this part of the story matters ? and will come to matter even more in
the future. Products that are disconnected from people will leave people feeling, well,
disconnected. And retail is nothing if it is not about emotion.Part of what is so intriguing to me about our company is that our story is still evolving, and
we have a great opportunity to shape it. Frankly, I¡¯m not satisfied with where the apparel
industry, including Gap Inc., is today on a variety of social and environmental issues. Many
times, creating change feels frustratingly slow. Yet change is more urgent now than ever,
for all of us. We face global challenges that require collective action. People everywhere
rely on vital resources like water to live; our company, too, can¡¯t survive without a healthy
environment. Likewise, we know that we can only thrive in a world in which all people
have the chance to do the same. This sense of connection is what encourages me that
change is not just possible, but imperative ? our futures are tied together, and we can¡¯t
afford not to act.Change is not just possible, but imperative ? our futures
are tied together, and we can¡¯t afford not to act.We don¡¯t pretend to have all the answers, but I have personally experienced what we
can make happen as one of the world¡¯s largest apparel retailers. Over the past few years,
we raised the hourly wage for more than 60,000 Gap Inc. employees, a step we hoped
would help individual people while also sparking broader change ? and in fact, other
retailers followed suit. In September 2015, we announced our commitment to expand
our P.A.C.E. program to educate one million women throughout the world by 2020. We
started P.A.C.E. to help the women who make our clothes gain the skills and confidence
to advance at work and at home, and it is both exciting and humbling to set a goal to reach
women on a much greater scale.
At the same time, in some areas our story does not yet align with our aspirations. A case
in point is the environment. We have more to do to address critical issues across our
business operations. To spur our progress, we have set two ambitious goals that we are
announcing with this report: by the end of 2020, we commit to a 50 percent absolute
reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our owned and operated facilities globally
from 2015 levels, and to 80 percent waste diversion from landfill for our U.S. facilities.
We also know that while we have made progress when it comes to improving working
conditions inside factories, we still face challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being
of the people who make our clothes. Over the past few years, we have been reassessing
and redesigning our approach to how we can catalyze improvements.Our new partnership with Verit?, which focuses on measuring and improving the degree to
which garment workers feel valued and engaged at work, is a prime example, and we aim
to create other innovative approaches as we move forward.
I fully expect that we will be judged by our actions, but the heart of our story lies in our
commitment. We¡¯re not perfect, but what I can say without hesitation is that we are
committed to this work. We¡¯re striking up new partnerships, investing in new strategies
and testing new ideas. We believe we have a real opportunity to make a difference in
people¡¯s lives through our business.We don¡¯t pretend to have all the answers, but I have
personally experienced what we can make happen as
one of the world¡¯s largest apparel retailers.While the fashion industry has its challenges, it is also full of promise. The beauty of a
piece of clothing can extend outward to touch people and the world in ways that are far
from obvious. This potential is what drew me to Gap Inc. to begin with, and it is what
keeps me inspired as we chart our course for the future.

384,General Mills,1,USA,"Acknowledging and addressing the interrelationship of economic, environmental and social value is a necessity in today¡¯s world. For companies looking to responsibly address truly global challenges, it is also an opportunity. At General Mills, we call our approach ¡°Holistic Value Creation.¡± We look to create value holistically ? not only for our shareholders, our customers and our consumers, but also for our suppliers, our communities and our world. 
From China to Peru, we are more carefully considering business outcomes and external impacts. Through our products, we are continuously striving to make consumers¡¯ lives healthier, easier and richer. Through our actions, we are simultaneously working to source responsibly, to conserve the natural resources on which our products depend and to strengthen the communities producing them. 
Our world faces unprecedented challenges. Today, almost 1 billion people lack sufficient food ? and the number 
of hungry is likely to only increase. Current projections suggest the world¡¯s population will reach 9 billion people by 2050. Essential natural resources ? especially water and arable land ? are already under severe stress in parts of the planet, creating chronic challenges for millions. Producing enough food to feed an increasingly hungry world will require not only innovation and dedication, but also careful attention to the impact of agriculture on our environment. 
In this, our 43rd year of reporting back to our communities and stakeholders, we have expanded the breadth and depth of our reporting across five key focus areas: Health, Environment, Sourcing, Workplace and Community. We continue to make progress in advancing our stated goals in these key focus areas. For example, in 2012, we again improved the health profile of General Mills products around the world. We again decreased natural resource consumption in our operations and across our global supply chain. We are 
mitigating water risk, and taking steps to more sustainably source raw materials. Of course, we also continue to support our employees with safe, ethical and inclusive workplaces. And we continue to nourish our communities through philanthropic and employee engagement. 
We¡¯re not alone in addressing these global challenges. We¡¯re finding opportunities for collaboration with business, government and NGOs on important systemic solutions. We¡¯re working with external partners and are signatories on a number of key global efforts, such as the United Nations Global Compact. And while we¡¯re proud of our progress, we also know there is still much more to be done.

In response to this challenge, General Mills announced in 2013 our commitment to sustainably source  100 percent of our 10 priority ingredients by 2020 ? representing more than 50 percent of our annual raw material purchases. Through our sustainable sourcing work, we¡¯re ensuring the long-term viability of our business while advancing sustainable agriculture and strengthening responsible practices throughout the supply chain.
Our consumers around the world will face many challenges related to food and nutrition in the coming years. We view our role in this equation as being part of the solution ? through our products, consumer education and philanthropic efforts, we promote healthy lifestyles that balance 
consumption and activity. We have nutritionally improved more than 750  of our products since 2005. We improve the safety of food around the world by sharing our best practices across the industry, including training suppliers to meet international food safety standards. The safety of the food we produce ?  and of our employees ? is a top priority  across the company.
We recognize the importance of transparency to our stakeholders and have made progress in this area. This past year, General Mills was named to the 2013 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. This placement reflects our operational efforts to be more sustainable as well as our commitment to more transparent reporting. Additionally, we conducted our first materiality assessment with internal and external stakeholders. The assessment  informs our understanding of key business and sustainability topics and their longer-term relevance to General Mills. 
We collaborate with others to address global challenges and pursue solutions related to our sustainability priorities. Through collaboration with businesses, governments and nongovernmental organizations, we work to advance systemic improvements in the areas of health, sustainable agriculture and community investment. We work with external partners and are signatories on 
a number of key global efforts, such as the United Nations Global Compact. We are encouraged by the progress we¡¯re making and remain committed to our pursuit of continuous improvement.
In this, our 44th year of reporting back to our communities and stakeholders, we provide updates across five key focus areas: Health, Environment, Sourcing, Workplace and Community. Our 2020 sourcing commitment, health profile improvements and water stewardship efforts are among the highlights of the year. Our progress helps move us toward our goal of being one of the most sustainable food companies on the planet.
Thank you once again for your interest. As always, we welcome your questions and comments.

386,General Mills,3,USA,"At General Mills, our goal is to stand among the world¡¯s most responsible food companies. We are committed to creating economic, social and environmental value around the world as we pursue our mission of Nourishing Lives.
As a key step to enhance our global responsibility strategy and to promote transparency, we conducted a materiality assessment in 2013. This assessment included input from both internal and external stakeholders regarding the most relevant economic, social and environmental issues to our business. We identify and address these issues throughout this report. 
Meeting diverse consumer needs is one of our priority issues. Increasingly, consumers worldwide are interested in the connection between food, health and wellness. General Mills puts consumers first by delivering a broad range of products that meet varying consumer needs and preferences. One example is the growing demand for organic and limited-ingredient products. Today, General Mills is the fourth-largest natural and organic food producer in the U.S.
Our customers, partners, consumers and other stakeholders also want to know more about where and how the ingredients in our foods are grown and processed. As the global food business balances increased demand with the need to conserve natural resources, efforts aimed at transparency and traceability 
are helping to improve the sustainability of food supply chains. At General Mills, we are making great strides toward our commitment to sustainably source 100 percent of our 10 priority ingredients by 2020 ? representing more than 50 percent of our annual raw material purchases. Through our sustainable sourcing work, we are advancing sustainable agriculture and strengthening responsible practices.
Our focus on health and wellness extends beyond the people who make and consume our food. Through our consumer education and philanthropic efforts, we promote healthy lifestyles that balance consumption and activity. Our work to alleviate hunger and improve nutrition includes our support of Partners in Food Solutions, a nonprofit organization we founded to help raise living standards, address chronic food supply issues and respond to extreme hunger in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Leading with safety ? both the safety of our employees in the workplace and the food they make ? is one of the key operating principles that guides our work. At our facilities around the world, we are committed to food safety and strictly adhering to the processes and standards we have pioneered and led since our founding. One hundred percent of our facilities are audited using globally recognized food safety criteria. We also share our best practices across the industry, including training suppliers to meet international food safety standards. 
Through collaboration with businesses, governments and nongovernmental organizations, we work to advance systemic improvements in the areas of health, sustainable agriculture and community investment. We collaborate with external partners and are signatories to a number of key global efforts, such as the United Nations Global Compact, which we continue to endorse. We are encouraged by the progress we¡¯re making and remain committed to our pursuit of continuous improvement.
In this, our 45th year of reporting back to our communities and stakeholders, we provide updates across five key focus areas in this report: Health and Wellness, Sourcing, Environment, Workplace and Community. We have focused on providing transparency and insights into the topics that are important to our stakeholders and to our business. Our continued progress in these areas helps move us toward our goal of being one of the most sustainable food companies on the planet.

590,General Mills,4,USA,"To our stakeholders. For 150 years, General Mills has been serving the world by making food people love. Our goal is to continue doing so by treating the world, its resources and people with care. In 2015, we made substantial commitments in support of that goal as we strive to be one of the world¡¯s most responsible food companies. We put people first. Respect for human rights is core to our commitment to conduct business in an ethical manner. In 2015, we launched our Policy on Human Rights, updated our Supplier Code of Conduct and signed the UN Women¡¯s Empowerment Principles. Treating all people with respect is a principle that guides our work. A healthy planet is also critical to our business. We took concrete steps to protect it in 2015 by addressing climate change and water use. From setting science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain to introducing a corporate water policy and signing the CEO Water Mandate, we are committed to protecting our natural resources. We continue to make progress toward our commitment to sustainably source 100 percent of our 10 priority ingredients by 2020 ? representing more than 50 percent of our annual raw material purchases. Through our sourcing work, we are advancing sustainable agriculture, strengthening responsible practices, and improving the transparency and traceability of food supply chains. We further expanded our portfolio and continued to improve the healthfulness of our products. We delivered on a 2010 commitment to lower sodium in our top 10 categories that contribute sodium into the diet and reduced sugar in many parts of our portfolio. We also reformulated a number of our products to respond to the preferences of consumers seeking wellness benefits in the food they purchase. For example, we eliminated artificial colors and flavors in our cereals, increased our gluten-free products, and are now the second-largest U.S. producer of glutenfree products and the third-largest U.S. natural and organic food producer. Through collaboration with businesses, governments and nongovernmental organizations, we work to advance systemic improvements in the areas of health, sustainability and our communities. We collaborate with external partners and are signatories to a number of key global efforts, including the United Nations Global Compact, which we continue to endorse. Our philanthropic work to alleviate hunger and improve nutrition includes food product donations that enabled 20 million meals globally in 2015. We also continued our support of Partners in Food Solutions, a nonprofit organization we founded to help raise living standards and address chronic food supply issues in Africa. In this, our 46th year of reporting back to our communities and stakeholders, we provide updates across four key focus areas: Health and Wellness, Sustainability, Workplace and Community. We have focused on providing transparency into the topics that are important to our stakeholders and to our business. We are encouraged by the progress we¡¯re making and remain committed to doing even more. Thank you for your interest. As always, we welcome your questions and comments.

387,General Motors,1,USA,"I am very pleased to report that in 2012 General Motors created significant long-term value for our customers and stockholders through the award-winning products we build, our strong business results, leadership on environmental issues and meaningful interaction with the communities in which we operate. 
As you will read in this report, our sustainability strategy is guided by this simple truth: energy diversity, resource conservation and CO2 reduction are business imperatives.
Sustainability also can deliver revenue opportunities, cost savings and risk mitigation. You can see sustainability in action in everything we¡¯re doing to grow our business globally ? whether it¡¯s launching new products like the Chevrolet Cruze diesel in North America, or increasing our efficiency worldwide through responsible manufacturing.
For example, we generate about $1 billion annually to the top line through recycling and reuse activities, and we avoided $66 million in energy costs through conservation activities since 2010 ? even as production increased 6 percent.
These examples underscore operational benefits, but GM¡¯s most compelling business case for sustainability lies with the customer. Whether out of concern for their budgets or the planet or both, customers today want vehicles with better fuel economy.
We¡¯re satisfying this need through a wide range of  technologies, from vehicle mass reductions to thermodynamic efficiency improvements for gas engines. In markets where it makes customer sense, we¡¯re deploying more engines that can run on clean diesel, compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas .
Though still in the early stages of commercialization, the era of using electricity to help improve performance and fuel economy is here and growing. So much so that we¡¯ve dedicated a portion of this year¡¯s report to discuss the many implications electrification is having on our portfolio and how customer needs are shaping our strategy ? a concept we call ¡°customer-driven sustainability.¡±our confidence in these fuel-saving technologies has led us to make several u.S. product-related commitments, including: ?  To have 500,000 vehicles on the road with some form of electrification by 2017. ?  To be a leader in fuel economy by doubling the models that can achieve 40 mpg highway or better by 2017. ?  To lower carbon emissions from products by reducing average u.S. fleet Co2 emissions by 15 percent by 2016 and, in Europe, opel/Vauxhall fleet Co2 emissions by 27 percent by 2020.
our sustainability commitment also extends to how we build our products. From 2010 to 2012, we reduced the energy intensity per vehicle produced by 5 percent, on the way to achieving a 20 percent reduction by 2020. Likewise, we are committed to reducing our Co2 production footprint by 20 percent by 2020.
For two consecutive years, we¡¯ve made year-over-year progress against these targets, as well as seven other  production-related commitments ? several in areas where GM is already a benchmark company, such as landfill-free waste management and renewable energy use.
It¡¯s also important to note that our commitment extends up and down the supply chain. True customer-driven sustainability must involve everything we do and everyone who touches our products.
There¡¯s no question sustainability can lead to value creation within GM, but we believe great companies use their strengths to lead, set an example and solve issues.  
Energy security is an area where GM has a role to play. The united States is on the cusp of achieving long-term energy security, thanks to its massive shale gas reserves, improved efficiency and more. This is a perfect opportunity to develop a cohesive, consumer-driven, national energy policy that ensures responsible, affordable access to energy for years to come. We can get this done by bringing all players ? both public and private ? to the table to negotiate a balanced policy with clear targets and timelines.We believe this can be done. The most recent agreement on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or ¡°CAFE¡± laws, demonstrates what can be achieved when people work together. The resulting CAFE regulation sets realistic targets for automakers, while making meaningful progress in fuel economy and greenhouse gas reduction.
Closely related to energy security is climate change. We became the first automaker to sign the Climate Declaration, a statement from Ceres and its Business for Innovative Climate & Energy policy coalition.  As a signatory, we¡¯re asking policymakers to take action on climate change by promoting clean energy, boosting efficiency and limiting carbon emissions ? strategies that make as much sense for the u.S., or any country, as they do for our own business.
In closing, this is our second full Sustainability report as the General Motors Company. We¡¯ve made improvements in our reporting approach and process, and we hope you¡¯ll let us know what you think by leaving us feedback. We appreciate your interest in GM and look forward to keeping you updated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
388,General Motors,2,USA,"By the time this Sustainability Report report. reaches your hands, all of us at GM South America will still be celebrating the satisfaction in receiving a distinguished recognition: the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification for our Joinville plant in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, less than one year from the beginning of its operation. This is a very important recognition to share with every single person who is part of GM South America, because it is more than just a certificate: it is a milestone for our permanent objective to be consistent with our principles of sustainability. We also want to share our happiness and pride with our primary audiences: partners such as our fleet customers, investors and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), especially environmental and social advocacy groups that are aware of our achievements and understand the challenges of our business. The South America region has become a very competitive market and it is possible to say that we, at GM, have made significant progress in several areas this past year: ? Quality through compliance with the objectives of both internal and external metrics, including certification of factories in various achievements. We are aware that this is a permanent objective, and we are undoubtedly headed in the right direction. ? Positive results in customer satisfaction surveys, in which several countries exceeded 85 percent of customers completely satisfied with their shopping experiences and 80 percent of customers fully satisfied in the after-sales service. ? Sales of parts and accessories, which generate a significant contribution to the results of the region, reported record sales and earnings in many countries despite the relatively slow growth of the automotive park. ? We took very important steps in the whole region to make our operations more competitive with long-term labor agreements that represent a victory for the workers and for the Company. ? Thanks to our excellent product portfolio and strong dealer network, we were able to gain the high regard of our clients for the Chevrolet brand. In fact, we have been transforming ourselves, and it is no coincidence that the business transformation project that began in our region was given the name ¡°Innovate,¡± and our plan is to align it closely with the cultural change we are making in the organization. The question we have challenged ourselves with is ¡°Where can we innovate?¡± A short list of some good examples to help illustrate the challenge lying ahead: the next generation of our models will have to make greater use of lighter materials; more modern engines need to comply with emissions standards of the countries, which tend to increase costs and force us to innovate in design, engineering, development of parts suppliers and manufacturing, in order to reduce costs. To be sustainable we will need a new approach with our dealers to reduce the cost of distribution and logistics, as well. The cost of transporting vehicles from factories to the most distant places in each country is often greater than the cost of assembling them, which does not add value to our customers and reduces our profitability. So we need a radical change in the process of delivery of the vehicle. We continue to focus on all of those challenges and more, and they will serve to inspire all of us at GM South America to win with determination, integrity and pride in excellent customer service. We can confidently say that the Company is prepared for the challenges ahead in South America.
Jaime Ardila, President, GM South America",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
389,General Motors,3,USA,"We made significant strides in the face of an extraordinary set of challenges that we took head on, and we are a stronger company today because of what we learned and the progress we have made. our core operating results in 2014 reflect what¡¯s possible as we work to deliver more sustainable value for our company as well as our customers and communities.
at GM, strengthening our company while building stronger communities and a better world through improved mobility defines our approach to sustainability. personal mobility means freedom. it means economic advancement. it means connected families and communities. it also means a world of safer and smarter vehicles ? cars, trucks and crossovers that use less fuel; that have less environmental impact; and that are programmed to help drivers avoid accidents and reduce congestion.
by far, people are the most important drivers of these efforts, and every other initiative at our company. building a winning culture is a priority and a key takeaway from the issues of 2014, which underscored our need to change behaviors within GM. this winning culture demands candor, accountability and an unwavering focus on customers.
all of us are committed to serving and improving the communities in which we live and work. i am proud of the hundreds of activities and thousands of hours that GM employees volunteer each year that result in better schools and safer, smarter and healthier communities.
to fully realize the benefits of mobility, we need to ensure we have a robust pipeline of talent to add to our global workforce. Getting students excited about science, technology, engineering and math (SteM) is an important area of focus. SteM programs not only create opportunities for students, these same programs can also help us attract the next generation of GM engineers, designers and it specialists to develop and deliver industry-leading products and services for our customers.
today, GM supports SteM education in nearly all of our markets. We are among the founding sponsors of global programs such as the partners for the advancement of Collaborative engineering education (paCe) and the FiRSt¢ç Robotics Competition, which facilitate collaborative learning, innovative projects and competitions for students worldwide.
together with Sae international, we also co-founded the program, a World in Motion (aWiM), designed to help bring SteM education to life through interactive learning experiences for elementary, 
middle school and high school students. today, hundreds of GM employees and retirees volunteer in nearly 400 classrooms across the u.S. as part of the aWiM program. i am excited by these and other educational efforts led by our employees all around the world, and we intend to build upon this foundation in the years ahead.
CuStoMeR FoCuSed at GM, who we are starts with the goal of earning customers for life. this means making their safety our top responsibility and ensuring that every interaction surpasses their expectations. the ignition switch recalls we experienced were galvanizing, and our response has been far-reaching. We took action to make GM a much more customer-focused company and built what i believe is one of the best safety organizations in the industry. We added more investigators. We reorganized our vehicle engineering department to improve systems integration. We¡¯ve improved our data collection and analysis, and much more. Most importantly, we¡¯re instilling a ¡°zero defects¡± mindset across the company.We will be relentless in our pursuit of zero defects and we¡¯re starting from a solid base. according to J.d. power and associates, the reliability of GM vehicles in the united States has improved for seven straight years. buick has been on J.d. power¡¯s top 10 brand list for long-term reliability every year for the past decade, while Cadillac currently ranks fourth, with Chevrolet and GMC ranking 10th (in a tie).
in addition, Chevrolet, GMC and buick took three of the top four spots in customer satisfaction in the J.d. power dealer Service index, and they recognized Cadillac as a 2014 Customer Champion for the third time.
Quality is a key driver of customer satisfaction, and we¡¯re seeing that reflected in the growth of our brands. last year, three regional brands ? buick, Wuling and baojun ? saw record sales, and GM as a whole recorded its second consecutive year of record vehicle sales globally.
industry experts view our current vehicle lineup as the best our company has ever offered. it¡¯s also our most environmentally efficient portfolio across multiple segments: ?  About 40 percent of the vehicles we sell today achieve fuel efficiency of at least 30 mpg highway and for the 2015 model year, six cars have fuel efficiency of 40 mpg or better. ?  The Chevy Colorado, Motor Trend magazine¡¯s unanimous choice for 2015 truck of the year, has reinvented the  midsize truck with segment-leading fuel efficiency ? a u.S. environmental protection agency (epa) estimated 20 mpg city and 27 mpg highway on a two-wheel drive model with  a 2.5l engine and an automatic transmission ? while also meeting customers¡¯ needs for performance. ?  Our steadfast commitment to electrification and delivering innovative products for our customers is reflected in the second-generation Chevrolet Volt, which will be available in the fall of 2015. also, given the strong public reaction to the Chevrolet bolt eV concept, with an expected electric range of up to 200 miles based on our latest testing, we announced there will be a production version in the near future.
the all-new Chevrolet Volt is an important example of how we listen to our customers. the next-generation Volt has been developed using insights from existing Volt customers, who are among the most satisfied vehicle owners in the marketplace. these customers provided input on a host of things from design to performance, and we rely on this insight to help exceed their expectations for mobility.
adVanCed teChnoloGy along with our commitment to electrification, we intend to lead in two other advanced technology areas that create value for our customers today and will help define mobility solutions of the future ? connectivity and intelligent driving systems.
in 2014, we made onStar 4G lte available in the united States and Canada on more than 30 2015 models. in 2015, onStar 4G lte will be introduced in europe and China as the next phase of delivering connectivity for our customers around the world. Connectivity, however, is about so much more than making our vehicles ¡°rolling hotspots¡± that connect customers to family, friends and work.
in the summer of 2015, we expect to launch a 4G lte-enabled technology that can predict when certain vehicle components may need attention and notify drivers ? in some cases before there¡¯s any impact on performance. initially, the feature is planned to be available on a number of 2016 models in the u.S. and Canada, including the Chevrolet equinox, tahoe, Suburban, Corvette and Silverado.
one of the many exciting developments at Cadillac will be the launch of ¡°Super Cruise,¡± which will put the brand at the forefront of intelligent driving systems. planned for introduction in the 2017 model year, Super Cruise is the working name for an innovative GM system that allows drivers in certain circumstances to operate the vehicle without touching the steering wheel or pedals.
also in the 2017 model year, Cadillac plans to introduce vehicle- to-vehicle connectivity, a wireless technology that has the potential to mitigate or help avoid many crashes involving unimpaired drivers.
We¡¯re convinced that customers will embrace these advanced technologies for very simple reasons: they enhance safety, increase situational awareness, and provide solutions that increase efficiency and integrate seamlessly into everyday life.
ReSponSible SteWaRdShip another key measure of excellence is efficiency ? leveraging our global scale and manufacturing processes to ensure optimal use of resources, be it time, energy, money or natural resources. our success has the potential to yield both financial and environmental returns.
in 2014, we increased the number of global facilities that have met the u.S. epa eneRGy StaR¢ç Challenge to an industry-leading total of 70 facilities located around the world. in total, these facilities have avoided $162 million in energy costs since we began tracking improvements for the Challenge in 2008. For these and other efforts, the epa awarded GM for the third year in a row its eneRGy StaR¢ç partner of the year ? Sustained excellence award, the organization¡¯s highest level of recognition for corporate energy management.
Responsible energy management also means diversifying our energy portfolio with renewable energy, which has not only lowered costs, but also mitigated risks such as exposure to volatile energy prices and electric grid interruptions that could disrupt our operations.
We are among only a handful of Fortune 100 companies with commitments for both increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy capacity. in 2014, we increased our renewable energy capacity by over 30 megawatts, and we will continue to explore new ways to expand our capabilities and promote renewable energy use among industrial energy buyers.
Consider also our progress in waste management. today, we have 122 landfill-free sites in the world, more than any other automaker. at 89 landfill-free manufacturing sites, we reuse or recycle approximately 94 percent of waste from daily operations and convert the other 6 percent to energy. in recent years, we have also generated over $1 billion in revenue from scrap sales and recycling activities around the world.
our leadership in waste management has inspired us to set an even more ambitious goal to be the first automaker in the world with all of our sites sending zero waste to landfill. While there are many challenges, some beyond our own control, we can set this aspirational target that continues to promote leadership, commit to sharing these best practices with our suppliers and partners, and continue to pass this value on for our customers and the environment.
GRoWth and oppoRtunitieS For our company¡¯s financial performance, i am pleased to report we have now delivered 20 consecutive profitable quarters through the end of 2014. For the year, we earned net income to common stockholders of $2.8 billion, including recall-related costs. ebit-adjusted, which is the metric we use to track our operating performance, was $6.5 billion, including $2.8 billion in recall- related costs and $1 billion in restructuring expenses. our core operating margin was 6 percent.
among the year¡¯s highlights: ?  In China, our joint ventures delivered record sales, market share and earnings. ?  In North America, through the end of 2014, we delivered six consecutive quarters, year over year, of improved core operating ebit-adjusted margins. Market share held steady despite the impact of recalls. ?  In Europe, Opel/Vauxhall enjoyed its second consecutive year of sales and share growth. ?  In South America, we posted a small loss, but even as conditions became more challenging, the team finished the year with three consecutive, quarter-to-quarter, improved ebit-adjusted results.
these and other achievements continue to deliver value for our shareholders, but it does not begin and end there. the greater, more enduring opportunity is to become the most valued automotive company for all of our stakeholders ? shareholders, customers, employees, communities and society alike.
this opportunity has never been as timely. We believe that the automotive industry is going to change more in the next five years than it has in the past 50 years. around the world, consumer expectations are changing. demands for better fuel efficiency, different propulsion options, enhanced communication technology, safer vehicles, and improved customer service are driving GM and others to reimagine products and services for our customers.
i see this as a great opportunity for GM to lead and redefine the future of our industry. and this opportunity is the driving force behind our business strategy and priorities today.
a betteR toMoRRoW our goal at GM is to be the clear leader in this era of  transformational change. From advanced safety technology  to fuel efficiency, operational excellence is an important part  of everything we do at GM. applying a sustainable mindset  to operational excellence helps drive how we can deliver the best mobility options for our customers today and tomorrow.
i know i speak for every GM employee when i say we are excited about the future. More than excited, we are inspired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
591,General Motors,4,USA,"Across the industry and around the world, social and technological changes are transforming personal mobility. I believe the auto industry will change more in the next five years than it has in the last 50, as we develop new options and modes of transportation for moving us from point A to B. This gives us an unprecedented opportunity to develop cleaner, safer, smarter and more environmentally friendly vehicles for our customers.
At GM, we¡¯re excited by this opportunity and working hard to lead it. We¡¯ve made strategic investments in technologies that are rewriting the rules of vehicle use and ownership, including connectivity, car-sharing, alternative propulsion and autonomous driving. We see tremendous potential in these technologies and huge long-term benefits for our customers and communities around the world.
DRIVING CONNECTIVITY Many of today¡¯s changes are made possible by connectivity, and GM¡¯s 20 years of OnStar experience give us a commanding lead. By the end of 2016, thanks to OnStar, we expect to have 12 million connected vehicles on four continents. We¡¯re also the industry leader in 4G LTE connectivity. In 2015, we sold seven times more 4G-equipped vehicles than the rest of the industry combined. And this is just the start of the OnStar story.
Since being introduced in 1996, OnStar has now responded to more than 1.2 billion customer requests. Even more exciting is where OnStar will take us in the future, as we build on our growing connections to expand the customer experience beyond the car.
SHARING OPTIONS An important change shaping personal mobility is the growth of the sharing economy. Today, an estimated 15 million people around the world use shared mobility services such as ridesharing and car-sharing. By 2020, this number is projected to be more than 50 million, and we plan to be a big part of it.
In 2015, we launched car-sharing programs in Germany, China and New York City. In early 2016, we announced new programs in Chicago and Ann Arbor, Michigan, and combined all our efforts under a single brand called Maven, which offers access to highly personalized, on-demand mobility services. Among other things, Maven¡¯s unique mobile app allows customers to bring their digital lives into the vehicle through services like OnStar, 4G LTE wireless, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and SiriusXM. Our goal is to offer an ownership-like experience with the convenience of car-sharing.
We¡¯re also very excited about a strategic alliance we announced in early 2016 with Lyft, the fastest-growing ridesharing company in the U.S. We believe the convergence of connectivity, ridesharing and autonomous vehicles will shape the future of personal mobility, and we¡¯re working across multiple fronts to create an integrated network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the U.S.
In the meantime, Lyft drivers and customers have access to our portfolio of cars and OnStar services, creating a richer ridesharing experience for drivers and passengers alike. We¡¯re also now a preferred provider of short-term-use vehicles to Lyft drivers through a number of U.S. rental hubs.
EXPANDING OUR ELECTRIC PORTFOLIO Another area where we¡¯re changing the industry is alternative propulsion.
Last year, we introduced the second-generation Chevrolet Volt, which is more capable and efficient than the first-generation Volt in every way. Last November, it was named 2016 Green Car of the Year by Green Car Journal, the second time Volt has won this prestigious award.
Building on the technology that enables Volt, we will start production this year on an all-new, all-electric vehicle called the Chevrolet Bolt EV. Bolt EV will feature a range of more than 200 miles and a price around $30,000 after government incentives. By putting truly cutting-edge technology within the reach of so many customers, Bolt EV cracks the code of affordability and long range.
Beyond the Chevrolet Volt and Bolt EV, we¡¯re working to bring other breakthrough vehicles to customers around the world. In 2016, we launched the all-new Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid, which gets combined city-highway fuel economy of 47 miles per gallon, and we plan to introduce an all-new Cadillac plug-in hybrid EV in 2017. In China, we expect to introduce 10 alternative-propulsion vehicles in the next five years, from hybrids and plug-in electrics to pure electric vehicles. We also expect to be the first foreign automaker to open a batteryassembly plant in China.
ADVANCING AUTONOMOUS DRIVING Active safety technology and rapid advances in connectivity are providing the foundation for increased vehicle automation. At the same time, we are developing fully autonomous vehicles, which will offer customers greater convenience, lower cost and improved safety.
To capitalize on GM¡¯s deep engineering talent and speed the arrival of self-driving cars, we created a new Autonomous and Technology Vehicle Development team this past February. The team will focus on everything from electrical controls and software to safety integration and vehicle development ? all crucial elements to realizing the full promise of autonomous vehicles. We¡¯re also excited about our pending acquisition of San Francisco?based Cruise Automation, a leading startup in autonomous technology.
In 2017, we will take an important step toward autonomous vehicles when we introduce ¡°Super Cruise¡± technology on the Cadillac CT6. Super Cruise is a highway driving automation technology that will enable hands-free driving, even in stop-and-go traffic.LEADING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH As we work to shape and lead these exciting changes in personal transportation, we are building on and leveraging the strength of our core business. ? Financial Resources: In 2015, GM recorded its third consecutive year of record sales, generated record net income and continued to maintain a strong balance sheet, all of which gives us the capital to invest in new technologies and services. ? Operating Scale: Last year, GM sold more than 9.9 million vehicles around the world, volume that provides the scale and leverage necessary for us to commercialize advanced new products and technologies. ? Product Quality: Around the world, we believe GM employees are launching the best cars, trucks and crossovers we have ever built ? vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt and Bolt EV I mentioned earlier; Chevrolet Camaro and Colorado, the 2016 Motor Trend Car and Truck of the Year winners; Opel Astra, the 2016 European Car of the Year; the all-new Cadillac XT5 mid-size luxury crossover; Buick Cascada, the first Buick convertible offered in the U.S. in 25 years; and many more. ? Intellectual Capital: Around the world, we employ tens of thousands of researchers, scientists, engineers, IT professionals and workers with technical degrees ? employees with the talent and skill to transform the industry. We are also investing millions to support science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education to prepare, train and attract future generations of talent globally.
LEADING THROUGH ACTION Being a global automotive leader, we need to consider not only the vehicles we make, but also how we make them ? and today that¡¯s with ever-increasing efficiency. As detailed in this year¡¯s report, we used less energy and water, generated less waste and emitted less carbon to manufacture a vehicle in 2015 than ever before. Our focus on efficiency also extends to materials and logistics, where we saved approximately $2 billion during 2015. These are wins for both our business and the environment.
GM also continues to lead in the area of renewable energy. Today our solar, landfill gas, hydro and waste-to-energy applications make us one of the largest industrial users of renewable energy in the world. To date, we have used renewable energy to reduce the overall carbon footprint of our facilities and save more than $80 million. In 2016, we expect to add 64 megawatts of wind power to our renewable energy portfolio, offsetting part of our energy use in Mexico and at our Arlington, Texas, assembly plant. By obtaining this power through Power Purchase Agreements, we are enabling third-party investment to support the growth of the wind industry.
I¡¯m also proud to say that, through the combined efforts of our manufacturing teams and union partners, GM continues to lead the industry in landfill-free facilities, which now number 131 around the world.
Our commitment to environmental stewardship and social responsibility was underscored in 2015 when we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, the world¡¯s largest corporate responsibility initiative. As a signatory, GM pledges to support and promote the compact¡¯s 10 principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. Our intent is not only to uphold these principles, which are closely aligned with our core values and practices, but also to seek opportunities to collaborate with others in the U.N. network to advance broader initiatives such as the organization¡¯s Sustainable Development Goals.GM is also an active participant in a number of key environmental initiatives, including action to engage in the issue of climate change.
BEHAVIORS AND VALUES With so many changes transforming the global auto industry, it¡¯s more important than ever that we maintain a consistent understanding within GM of who we are and why we are here.
It starts by putting customers at the center of everything we do. Throughout the company, we listen intently to our customers¡¯ needs. We focus on things that delight and add value for the customer, with the ultimate goal of earning customers for life. Quality and safety ? both customer and workplace ? are foundational commitments, never compromised. We¡¯ve also made a clear commitment to become the industry leader in workplace and vehicle safety, and we are working diligently and making steady progress toward achieving this goal.
We build relationships inside and outside the company by holding ourselves accountable and keeping commitments. Individually and collectively, around the world, we do what we say we are going to do.
And we drive excellence into everything we do. We look over the horizon to anticipate what¡¯s coming, we look for opportunities in every challenge, and we demonstrate the tenacity to win in all things. We act with integrity and take accountability for our results. 
I am very proud of the more than 200,000 men and women around the world who make GM what it is today. Our employees are talented, passionate and highly committed to working and winning for our customers.
ACCELERATING AHEAD Going forward, we are working to develop and fully capitalize on the new technologies and services that are transforming today¡¯s global auto industry. These changes will allow us to build on the advances we have already made to improve safety for our customers, save energy and reduce emissions. I believe the opportunities to create lasting change and environmental benefits are greater today than they have ever been, and I¡¯m excited about our work at GM to lead the way.
We look forward to partnering with you, our stakeholders, as we continue to serve and improve the communities in which we live and work around the world. Thank you for your support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
390,Halliburton,3,USA,"Our financial success in 2014 was
a testament to the e
ectiveness of
taking a big view. In 2014, we grew
revenue to a new record of $32.9 billion,
and returned 33 percent of operational
cash flow to our shareholders.
Sustainability, too, is a ¡°Big Vision,¡±
shaping our business decisions
from the field to the executive suite.
Our success in achieving our sustainability
vision is measured by our
Guiding Principles for Sustainability.
In this report, we describe the actions
through which we uphold them,
and the impact of those actions on
our employees, our Company, our
communities, our customers and
our industry.
Having a positive impact in our
technology development e
orts is
among our most important objectives.
We are innovators and problem
solvers, and our technologies are
geared toward addressing specific
challenges. Our technologies also
give our customers options that
improve their sustainability.
For example, our Frac of the Future¢â
hydraulic-fracturing system, conceived
in 2010 and now deployed in
more than 30 percent of our North
America fleet, has lowered costs for
our customers while also improving
our revenues. It has reduced capital
deployed by 25 percent and maintenance
costs by up to 50 percent, and
has improved completion times in
some cases by more than 50 percent.
It also makes fracturing operations
cleaner and safer, and improves surface
eciency at wellsites by reducing
the number of people, the amount
of equipment, and the time required
to complete the operation. For local
communities, this means lower
fuel use, fewer trucks going through
towns and less trac disruption.
The economic, environmental and
social impacts of Frac of the Future
are positive and widely felt. (More
information about Frac of the Future
is on page 34.)
The industry, too, has acknowledged
the positive impact of our innovative
technologies. We received several
2014 World Oil Awards for solutions
that spanned deepwater, unconventional
and mature fields. These
awards include:
? Best Visualization and
Collaboration: CYPHER?
Seismic-to-Stimulation Service
? Best Data Management
and Application Solution:
DecisionSpace¢ç G1 Edition
? Best Drilling and Completions
Fluid: SentinelCem¢â Cement
Our big vision for sustainability
extends to all our communities ?
our Halliburton employee community,
the local communities where
we work, and the global community.
Our impact has been positive and
substantial in all three.
We have made significant progress
in our Journey to ZERO ? our drive
to eliminate safety incidents, environmental
incidents and nonproductive time ? improving our performance on
every key metric. Our highest priority,
of course, is protecting the health and
safety of our employees; we achieved
a 17 percent decrease in health and
safety incidents. Similarly, we reduced
environmental incidents and cost of
poor quality by 10 percent and 34 percent
respectively while nonproductive
time decreased by 17 percent. Impressive
as these  numbers are, their bigger
impact is much more important: safer
employees, a healthier environment,
and better service quality.
Halliburton and its employees see
beyond our locations and jobsites to
communities both nearby and around
the world. Company donations and
in-kind gifts, combined with employees¡¯
volunteer work and charitable
donations, have made life better for
countless families and communities.
Our vision is to establish ourselves as
an economic contributor and as a
good neighbor, connected to and
involved with the people in whose
communities we do business.
Living and working according to our
Guiding Principles for Sustainability
is a big vision. They are at the heart
of Halliburton culture, and are key drivers
of our success. Halliburton board
members, employees, customers, suppliers
and shareholders embrace this
vision wholeheartedly, and they share
in the Company¡¯s accomplishments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
592,Halliburton,4,USA,"Our Company¡¯s success is the direct result of strategic planning and innovation for the
long-term. Across the value chain, we take the big view. We look at how our initiatives affect
our Company across the business cycle, as well as how they affect our customers, suppliers
and the industry. As an industry leader we believe that this vision will best serve our
customers, our shareholders and our communities, now and far into the future.
Central to this are our Guiding Principles for Sustainability: Financial Performance; Health,
Safety and Environment; Technology and Innovation; Global Citizenship; Transparency; and
Collaboration. This report summarizes the actions we took in 2015 to uphold these Principles,
and the progress that we made.
The success of Halliburton is not only defined by our financial performance, but also by the
quality of our products and services, the talent and dedication of our workforce, the integrity
of our actions and our relationships with our communities.
In 2015, our health and safety performance continued to improve, with reductions in both the
number and severity of health and safety incidents, lowering our total recordable incident rate
by 18 percent ? building on our historical best performance in 2014. Environmental incidents
were reduced, along with our carbon footprint, which was 148 metric tons for every million
dollars of revenue, down by 59 percent year on year. Road safety continues to be a key risk
area, which led us to strengthen our road safety standards and our proactive driver safety
programs in 2015.
Service quality and execution are key differentiators for Halliburton. Our commitment to
service quality is shown by our industry leadership in API Q2 certification, the industry
standard for quality management for the energy services industry; 37 of our facilities around
the world achieved this certification in 2015.
In our financial performance, we outperformed the market and our peer group both in
North America and internationally, despite the turbulent market conditions. We have pursued
a solid course of cost containment to sustain us over the past year and help us look ahead
with confidence to a market recovery. We believe that the actions taken in 2015 will enable
Halliburton to emerge from this cycle prepared to deliver competitive growth and returns.
Innovation allows us to improve environmental performance for us and our customers. In
each of our key strategic areas ? deep water, mature fields and unconventional assets ? we
have developed products with unique environmental benefits. For example, our CleanSpacer¢â
III Spacer Fluid is a biodegradable fluid designed to be collected and distributed in disposal
fields where naturally occurring microorganisms degrade the components. Our CoilComm¢â
Service uses fiber optics to provide the high-quality data clients need, while it optimizes the
chemical treatments required for interventions and reduces the number of trips to the wellsite
to take measurements.In unconventionals, where the chief objective is to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil
equivalent for our customers, our AccessFrac¢ç Stimulation Service reduces both time and
cost for multi-zone fracturing. It features unique components that help optimize proppant
distribution for improved long-term production performance. AccessFrac service won the
2015 Hart Energy¡¯s E&P Meritorious Award for Energy Innovation.
In every aspect of our business, integrity is fundamental and non-negotiable. From the way
we treat our diverse global workforce, to our insistence on strict adherence to our Code
of Business Conduct, to our role as neighbor and advocate in communities where we do
business ? no goal or deadline or revenue opportunity ever takes precedence over maintaining
the highest ethical standards.
Living and working according to our Guiding Principles for Sustainability is a big vision.
But it is at the heart of Halliburton culture, and a key driver for our success. Halliburton
board members, employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders embrace this vision
wholeheartedly, and they share in the Company¡¯s accomplishments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This commitment dates back to our founders, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank. While they were running the company in our early days, they required senior leadership and merchants to participate in the ¡°Natural Step¡± Sustainability Program, which is based on a structured scientific understanding of the socio-ecological system. As a merchant at that time, I participated and learned first-hand how many of the decisions we make today could have lasting impacts for generations to come.
It¡¯s with this legacy that we review and address our corporate impact on a continuous basis, measuring our results against the goals we have set in the same way we measure profitability or inventory turns.
In 2010, we set a five year goal to reduce our stores¡¯ energy use by 20 percent. I¡¯m happy to report that we not only met that goal in 2014,

594,Home Depot,4,USA,"At The Home Depot, we approach sustainability and corporate responsibility with the mindset of  continuous improvement. We focus our efforts not only on our business operations, but also on our associates, communities and the products we sell.  Our merchants are continuously striving to develop more sustainable product assortments with  innovations like Lithium-Ion technology, and energy-saving, water-saving and organic-certified products to help customers create smarter homes that reduce their environmental impact. In fact, we helped  customers save more than 70 billion gallons of water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 4,000,000 metric tons in 2015 alone. For example, we moved the industry over the past several years from toilets that once consumed 3.5 to 5 gallons per flush to WaterSense¢ç toilets that use 1.28 gallons per flush. And in 2015, our merchants introduced a new toilet that uses only .08 gallons per flush. Our drive for innovation also helped shift the industry from incandescent to CFL to LED lighting technology, reducing homeowners¡¯ energy use by up to 80 percent per bulb. These efforts were recently recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with both WaterSense¢ç and ENERGY STAR¢ç Sustained Excellence awards. Continual sustainable improvements are also woven into our operations. In 2010, we set 2015 goals to reduce our store energy use by 20 percent over 2004 levels and greenhouse gas emissions from our  supply chain distribution by 20 percent over 2010 levels. We exceeded both of these targets, reducing  the company¡¯s in-store energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain distribution  by over 30 percent. As a result, the Carbon Disclosure Project assigned us a score of 99 out of 100 and rated us as a Global Industry Leader in carbon emission reduction and disclosure in 2015. The EPA has also recognized The Home Depot with a SmartWay Transport Excellence Award over the past several years. In this report, you¡¯ll see how we¡¯re augmenting these efforts through more sustainable energy sources such as solar, fuel cell and wind technologies. The Home Depot is focused on the social impacts of our industry, as well. In 2015, we performed more than 2,000 foreign factory audits and follow-up visits where we monitored working conditions, hourly wage rates and more than 100 additional checkpoints. In our communities, through The Home Depot Foundation and our Team Depot associate volunteer force, we have transformed more than 26,700 veterans¡¯ homes and facilities since 2011. In addition,  the Foundation increased its commitment to a quarter of a billion dollars by 2020 to help make a  difference in the lives of even more veterans. Our successes in 2015 and thus far in 2016 have positioned us to continue in a rapid pace to improve the social and environmental impacts of our company. I would like to personally thank all of our  associates and partners whose hard work and dedication helped us exceed our 2015 goals and have  positioned us for continued progress toward a sustainable future.

595,Ingersoll-Rand,1,USA,"Message from Our Chairman and CEO Dear Shareholder: I am pleased to report that Ingersoll Rand delivered strong performance in 2012. Our ability to grow earnings, cash flow and operating margins during weak market conditions affirms that our strategies?operational excellence, growth through innovation and a progressive, diverse and inclusive culture (PDI)?are the right ones to achieve premier performance. We have maintained a relentless focus on leveraging costs, investing in growth markets, increasing productivity, and deploying capital to fund growth and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. Highlighting Our Financial Performance When I became CEO in 2010, we began a journey to increase the operating capability of the company, focusing on innovation and operational excellence. These initiatives have increased our operating margins almost 400 basis points over the last three years, while enabling a consistent increase in investments in the business. Ingersoll Rand continued to make great progress in 2012. We improved the competitive strength of our businesses, increased operating margins and improved earnings per share (EPS). Below are some of our financial highlights: ? Year-over-year EPS increase of 23 percent on a 1 percent comparable revenue increase, excluding Hussmann; ? Annual dividend increase of 20 cents, reflecting a 31 percent increase; the dividend will, in 2013, exceed the 2008 peak dividend by 17 percent; ? Repurchased shares totaling $840 million; and ? Achieved one of the highest total shareholder returns in our peer group and outperformed the S&P 500 and S&P Industrials, as we have for three of the past four years. While pleased with our progress, we also had our share of challenges this year. Although our financial performance was strong, we did not achieve our growth objectives, largely due to slower economic conditions in many key markets around the world. Comparable revenue increased 1 percent to 2011 with full-year net revenues just over $14 billion. We know that premier performance cannot be achieved by productivity alone, and we are committed to growing revenues through operational excellence, innovation and investments to develop new markets. Operational Excellence. In the past year, we advanced our operational excellence to reduce working capital, expand operating margins and increase market share across our businesses. We define operational excellence as the implementation of lean principles throughout our value streams and within our functional processes, the strategic sourcing of materials and services as well as the strategic management and pricing of products and services. Our pricing excellence program delivered price realization that significantly surpassed direct material inflation. We improved our level of operational execution by adopting a centralized sourcing model. We also strengthened our capabilities in emerging markets to better support supplier qualifications, supplier development and strategic sourcing in those regions by localizing our engineering, research and development. An area of intense focus for us in 2012 was our value stream work, which expanded during the year to cover 30 percent of our operations. I am pleased the value streams continue to deliver superior results and show positive separation in performance versus the remainder of the company. The value streams reduced past due days by 66 percent, compressed cycle time by more than 40 percent and contributed to a five point increase in employee engagement scores compared with the remainder of the company. We plan to expand value stream coverage in 2013 to 40 percent of our enterprise operations. Growth through Innovation, Emerging Markets and Services Beyond operational excellence, we have also continued to invest in growth markets. Those investments are yielding a strong pipeline of new products and services in every sector of the business?from air compressors to unitary HVAC to electronic locks to new service offerings. We have almost doubled the proportion of our revenues from innovation, which we measure as the total revenues delivered by new products introduced over the last three years. Innovation revenues totaled approximately $3.3 billion in 2012. 2012 was marked with new products designed to meet customer needs and market demand. For example, our Thermo King business, launched the Precedent platform to address new regulations for engine emissions. Precedent set an industry standard in both fuel efficiency and emission reduction by delivering double-digit fuel savings, best-in-class performance and lower life cycle costs. We also launched the Ameristar home HVAC system, making headway into the entry-level, lower price point market segment. These customer-centric products, services and solutions are fundamental to our vision. We strive for continual improvement in our products, services and processes, and in the value we provide to our customers, employees and the communities we serve. We embrace sustainability as a catalyst for business growth and innovation. Ingersoll Rand¡¯s Center for Energy Efficiency and Sustainability (CEES) works collaboratively with our businesses to address global issues that impact energy, food and water by providing sustainable solutions, product stewardship and supporting initiatives that deliver results. As the company¡¯s sustainability thought leader, the CEES works with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), universities and industry leaders to identify trends and business opportunities to accelerate energy efficiency, drive growth for the company and better meet our customers¡¯ challenges. Progressive, Diverse and Inclusive Culture At Ingersoll Rand, our global success is powered by our employees¡¯ diverse backgrounds, experiences, skills and talents. We believe a culture of mutual respect, collaboration and inclusion improves employee retention and engagement, enabling Ingersoll Rand to deliver growth and maintain a competitive advantage in markets worldwide. One way we create this culture is through engaged employees who feel valued and believe their contributions are meaningful. Ingersoll Rand employee resource groups are an example of how we link engagement, diversity and innovation to drive growth. Employee resource groups afford employees the opportunity to spur innovative business ideas and participate in community involvement and recruiting events. In 2012, we expanded our Women¡¯s Network globally and launched our Black Employee Network and Veterans¡¯ Group, among others. We will continue to pursue this enterprise strategy to create a culture that is inclusive and allows for our diverse and highly capable employees to generate new ideas improving our performance and exceeding customer expectations globally. Leading Our Business into the Future I am confident we are on the right track. The numbers tell our story?we have three successive years of moving up in key operating metrics. We have built a multiyear record of growing earnings and cash flow with little help from our markets. We have achieved several years of delivering high operating leverage and margin improvement, while still investing. Our 2012 results are a testament to what our employees can achieve when we focus on our goals. The health and vitality of our businesses are excellent and I thank Ingersoll Rand employees around the world for their exceptional effort. We will continue to build our operational capability, further integrate our businesses and invest to foster profitable growth through innovation. 2013 will be a year that will redefine Ingersoll Rand. Work is under way to combine our residential and commercial security businesses and create a new, standalone public company. When the spin-off is complete, which is expected by the end of this year, the new security company will become a leading provider of electronic and mechanical security solutions for customers globally. The spin-off is expected to create value for both companies and their shareholders. This is a milestone in Ingersoll Rand¡¯s evolution to a premier performing company, creating a more focused company with greater opportunities for growth in areas of advantage that differentiate us from our competitors. Ingersoll Rand will continue to grow profitably from a more  focused core in creating comfortable, sustainable and efficient environments through its industrial, transport refrigeration and heating, ventilation and air conditioning businesses. I am excited by the opportunities ahead for Ingersoll Rand and by the opportunities the new security company will have as an independent enterprise. The collective inspiration and determination that have served our company, customers and communities for more than 140 years will ensure we continue to deliver for generations to come.
Sincerely,
Michael W. Lamach

397,Ingersoll-Rand,3,USA,"Over the last year I have visited with thousands of our customers and employees across North America,
Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Each conversation strengthened my conviction that we¡¯re on the
right path ? we¡¯ve built Ingersoll Rand with the right global trends in mind, the right businesses, the right
operating system and the right people to attain high engagement and deliver results. In 2014 we again
proved our model is working.
The Right Global Trends
A look at the trends reminds our global team that what we do every day matters.
The world population is projected to increase by almost one billion people within the next 12 years. More than
half of us reside in urban settings today, and this ratio is expected to approach two-thirds by 2050. The link
between urbanization and pressing global issues such as energy demand and food availability is at the center
of a global discussion ? and so is Ingersoll Rand.
Industrial motors and motor driven systems account for 43 percent of total global electricity demand with
compressors comprising about one-third of this demand. And buildings are one of the greatest consumers of
energy. Take New York City ? nearly three-quarters of its greenhouse gas emissions come from energy used
to heat, cool and power buildings. In Europe it is estimated that retrofitting existing buildings could eliminate
one-eighth of the region¡¯s total greenhouse gas emissions, making retrofits a needed component of any plan
to reduce emissions.
Beyond industry and buildings, the requirements for food transportation ? availability, access, utilization and
stability ? are also stressed by increased urbanization. Up to 40 percent of food harvested can be lost due to
inefficiencies in processing, storage and transport.
The key is for organizations with the right expertise to deliver innovative solutions to these challenges. That¡¯s
where Ingersoll Rand steps forward.
Our customers demand systems that are efficient and cost effective, but also productive and sustainable. The
bold Climate Commitment we announced in 2014, detailed in this report, demonstrates the industry-leading
position we have taken on their behalf. I was proud to represent Ingersoll Rand at the United Nations Climate
Summit and Clinton Global Initiative to launch this initiative.The Right Businesses
There is a powerful link between these global trends and our end markets. Our strategy and portfolio position
us to help create sustainable choices for our customers and spur the development of energy-efficient solutions
with lower greenhouse gas emissions while we continue to improve our business; whether it¡¯s Trane products
in commercial and residential buildings, Thermo King products to deliver fresh food over longer distances, or
Ingersoll Rand air compressors that lower operational costs for our industrial customers.
Our passion to be at the forefront of our industries propels our growth. And growth, when properly executed, is
the greatest source of employee and shareholder value.
We are growing Ingersoll Rand in three ways: by developing new and more productive and efficient products,
increasing the mix of our service businesses, and expanding market coverage in terms of geography or channels in
a specific end market.
We continue to execute our growth strategy and refine our product development process. Through rigorous
analysis, we provide a set of alternatives and choose the best solutions for our customers, and in turn, our
businesses. Aligning our product management teams to more clearly understand our customers, markets and
competitors empowers us to take action.
The Right Operating System
We¡¯ve also matured in our operational excellence journey ? focusing the whole company on creating a lean
operating system where we use standard work to create value, reduce cycle times and enhance quality that makes
the customer experience better.
2014 marked the intersection of our growth excellence and operational excellence strategies. Over the past
year we have launched six product growth teams. Just like our operational excellence value streams that use a
structured process for continuous improvement to deliver a better customer experience, these new growth teams
coordinate a product¡¯s journey from concept to delivery, through every stage of meeting a customer¡¯s needs. This
results in faster time to market, increased productivity and improved quality and delivery. Our product growth
teams grew their product lines at an average rate that was four times greater than the rest of Ingersoll Rand, and
we aim to systematically deploy this model across the company.
As we layer a foundation of operational excellence with a disciplined approach to growth and our winning culture,
you can see why I am confident in our future.
The Right People
Our philosophy is to make our company a great place for people to work which in turn drives a great customer
experience and ultimately, grows shareholder value.
We¡¯ve applied this philosophy to how we operate, and we continue to measure our progress. We achieved topquartile
employee engagement scores in 2014, and our people and company are attracting external attention. We have been recognized as one of FORTUNE magazine¡¯s World¡¯s Most Admired Companies, honored on Best
Companies for Leaders by Chief Executive magazine, Workforce Magazine¡¯s 100 top companies for Human
Resources and Corporate Responsibility magazine¡¯s 100 Best Corporate Citizens.
And we intend to keep getting better. Customers want to do business with people who are engaged to deliver
for them, and that¡¯s the kind of company we strive to be. That¡¯s our winning culture as you¡¯ll read about in this
year¡¯s report.Delivering the Right Results
Beyond employee engagement, we are operating at the top quartile in other metrics that matter ? one look
at our strong 2014 financial results shows that. For the second year in a row, we delivered top-quartile organic
growth among our peer group, even in the absence of a North American institutional construction recovery.
We realized a 1.8 percentage point increase of adjusted operating margins over the last three years, and over the
past five years we¡¯ve grown market share and margins in almost every business in the company, in every region.
As a result, we¡¯ve delivered a 60 percent earnings per share growth since 2011, and strong shareholder return
while investing in the long-term success of the business. Executing on our balanced capital allocation strategy
over the last five years, we¡¯ve:
? Increased investments into the business, consistent with driving organic growth
? Increased the dividend 257 percent from 2011 ? 2014 and our 2015 dividend is set at $1.16 per
share, up 16 percent year-over-year
? Completed two share repurchase programs at $2 billion each, and now, we¡¯re well underway with
the third authorization for $1.5 billion
? Returned approximately $5.5 billion to shareholders
We¡¯ve also been disciplined around mergers and acquisitions, announcing two value-adding acquisitions in
2014. We purchased the assets of Cameron International Corporation¡¯s Centrifugal Compression Business,
which became part of our compressed air business in January 2015, and FRIGOBLOCK became part of our
Thermo King business in March 2015. Both acquisitions offer a complementary product set, engineering
and technology strength, and financial synergies that are a natural fit for our portfolio, and we expect them
to be accretive in 2015.
Looking ahead, we won¡¯t change what¡¯s working ? focusing on the fundamentals of growth, our operating
system and our culture to serve our customers. We want to be a company people want to work for, customers
want to buy from and investors want to invest in.
I hope you are as optimistic about our future as I am. It¡¯s clear to me how our employees, customers and
shareholders around the world all win with Ingersoll Rand. I look forward to continuing to grow the company
in 2015, and well beyond.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
398,Intel,1,USA,"At Intel, we believe that corporate responsibility
is simply good business. Doing the right
things the right way creates value for Intel
and strengthens our position as a global
technology and business leader. Deeply
embedding corporate responsibility and a
commitment to ethical behavior in all that
we do helps us mitigate risk, reduce costs,
protect our brand value, and develop new
market opportunities.
We believe that technology will continue to play a fundamental role in addressing the world¡¯s toughest environmental
and social challenges?from energy and water conservation and management to healthcare and education for all. Intel
has an ambitious vision: Create and extend computing technology to connect and enrich the life of every person on
Earth. One of our strategic objectives, in particular, supports this vision: ¡°Care for our people, care for the planet, and
inspire the next generation.¡±
Care for our people. Intel¡¯s success relies on our employees¡¯ ability to create and innovate?in technology, in
business, and in their communities. We invest significant resources in employee training and development, greatplace-to-work
and diversity initiatives, and programs that empower employees to volunteer with local schools and
nonprofit organizations. For example, through our Intel Involved program, our employees have donated more than
5 million hours of volunteer service around the world over the past five years. We measure our progress each year
by soliciting employee feedback through our annual Organizational Health Survey; in our 2012 survey, 88% of
employees reported that they are proud to work for Intel, up from 87% in 2011.
Care for the planet. We are committed to environmental leadership in our own operations, in our products,
and across our supply chain. Since 2008, Intel has been the largest voluntary purchaser of ¡°green¡± power in
the U.S., according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Our investments in energy conservation from 2008 through 2012 have saved more than 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours of energy, equivalent to removing 126,000
U.S. homes from the electric grid. We estimate that energy-efficient Intel¢ç technology will enable the billion PCs
installed between 2007 and 2014 to consume half the energy and deliver 17 times the compute capacity of the
first billion PCs and servers installed worldwide (between 1980 and 2007). We have also invested resources to
improve the accountability and transparency of our suppliers, and have formally integrated environmental metrics
in the scorecards we use in our supplier management and supplier recognition programs.
Inspire the next generation. We believe that success in today¡¯s innovation economy depends on access to
technology and quality education. Intel and the Intel Foundation invest approximately $100 million annually in
education programs around the world?from technology training for teachers to premier science fairs for students.
In 2012, we helped launch the Stay With It¢â campaign to help connect engineering students with each other and
with experienced engineers, role models, and influencers, and encourage them to stay with engineering as their
field of study. We also partnered on the launch of the ¡°Girl Rising¡± film and 10x10 social action campaign, which
highlights the importance of investing in the education of girls and women to advance economic opportunity.
We strive for continuous improvement in our own business, and collaborate with other organizations to advance best
practices in corporate responsibility worldwide. As a United Nations Global Compact LEAD member, we are committed
to transparency in reporting about our corporate responsibility performance and actions. We welcome your feedback
on this report, prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative* G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.
I will retire in May 2013 after almost 40 years at the company. I am proud of the progress we have made in corporate
responsibility during the eight years I have served as CEO. It has been an honor to work with the employees of Intel,
who every day move technology forward, empower people, and transform our world in ways we had never imagined.
I have no doubt that their innovations and actions will continue to improve lives while sustaining our business?and

399,Intel,2,USA,"From ultra-mobile and wearable devices to cloud computing and security, the technology universe is changing dramatically. During this unprecedented industry transformation, we remain as committed to leadership in corporate responsibility as we do to innovation in our products and technologies. We believe that corporate responsibility creates value  for our company, our stockholders, and society.
At Intel, our focus is on taking action and achieving results. I am especially proud of our leadership in the area of ¡°conflict minerals.¡± We have worked for five years to ensure that our products do not contain tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold derived from sources that benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries?making sure that we are still  able to source responsibly from the region. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture ¡°conflict-free¡± microprocessors. While this is a significant milestone, we will continue our work to establish ¡°conflict-free¡± supply chains for these minerals?for our company and our industry. 
Intel remains the largest voluntary purchaser of ¡°green¡± power in the U.S., according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a designation that we have held since 2008. We have also made substantial progress toward achieving our 2020 sustainability goals, and our focus over the next  few years will be on improving our own performance as well as that of our supply chain.
Energy-efficient performance remains a driving force in the design of our products. In 2013, we launched 4th generation Intel¢ç Core¢â processors that deliver industry-leading performance as  well as the largest generational gain in battery life in Intel¡¯s product history. 
As part of our efforts to encourage innovation and push the boundaries of imagination?in corporate research labs, classrooms, homes, and even garages?we collaborated with Arduino* to introduce the Intel¢ç Galileo development board, designed for the ¡°maker¡± and education communities. To spark the minds of young innovators and ignite new technologies, we plan to donate 50,000 Intel Galileo boards to 1,000 universities over 18 months. I am proud of Intel¡¯s ongoing efforts in education, many of which encourage hands-on learning that inspires the interest in science, technology, engineering, and math that is vital to our success.
In 2013, we also invested significantly in our employees through training and development, greatplace-to-work and diversity initiatives, and programs that encourage employees to volunteer with local schools and nonprofit organizations. These efforts helped us once again earn a spot on Fortune magazine¡¯s annual ¡°100 Best Companies to Work For¡± list.

400,Intel,3,USA,"If it is smart and connected, it is best with Intel. That¡¯s our corporate vision, but to us, ¡°best with Intel¡± goes far beyond just delivering great products. We are committed to developing energy-efficient technology solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our environmental impact. We seek to empower people and expand economic opportunity through education  and technology access. And we cultivate a work environment in which engaged, energized employees can thrive on the job and in their communities. These initiatives aren¡¯t an afterthought?they are integrated into the way we work, because they are good for our business. 
I am proud to work for a company that profoundly impacts the lives of people around the world every day. A great example is our six-year quest to ensure that our products do not contain tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold derived from sources that benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or adjoining regions. We have accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free for these minerals, and in 2014 set a new goal that all of the products on our roadmap for 2016 and beyond will be DRC conflict-free. Non-governmental organizations in the DRC report that lives are already changing in the DRC: Miners¡¯ wages are increasing, their working conditions are improving, and armed groups are being replaced by hospitals and schools in mining communities. In 2014 Intel once again topped the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency¡¯s list of ¡°green¡± power purchasers in the U.S., a position we have held since 2008. We also continue to work toward achieving our ambitious 2020 environmental goals. In 2014, both our absolute water use and solid waste generated decreased, and although our chemical waste generated increased, we sent just 5% of that waste to landfill. 
In 2014 we donated 43,000 Intel¢ç Galileo development boards to 1,900 universities around the world to encourage students to become makers of technology. We also launched the global Make It Wearable challenge, aimed at spurring young people to become entrepreneurs and inventors of wearable technologies. The $500,000 grand prize winner developed the first wearable camera that can fly. Based on the success of the challenge, Intel will premier an expanded Make it Wearable program in late 2015. 
We continue to make significant investments in employee training and development, programs to encourage employee volunteerism, and great-place-to-work initiatives. In support of our belief that a diverse workforce helps us advance our leadership in both technology and corporate responsibility, in early 2015 we announced a bold new goal to achieve full representation of women and under-represented minorities at Intel in the U.S. by 2020. As part of this initiative, we plan to invest $300 million in programs aimed at building a pipeline of female and under-represented technical talent.  
We remain strongly committed to reporting transparency and continuing leadership in corporate responsibility that creates value for our company, our stockholders, and society.

596,Intel,4,USA,"In 2015, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Moore¡¯s Law, which paved the way for Intel to build the ever faster, smaller, and more affordable transistors that  drive our modern world. This anniversary provided  us with the opportunity to reflect upon the increasingly transformational role that our technology plays in addressing global challenges and empowering people around the world. Beyond the impact of our products,  new ambitious goals and strategic investments in corporate responsibility are helping us drive improvements in environmental sustainability,  supply chain responsibility, diversity and inclusion,  and social impact.
Intel researchers are working on multiple environmental initiatives aimed at conserving resources, cutting emissions, and boosting efficiency in transportation systems, homes, buildings, and cities. We continue to make significant investments in resource conservation  and efficiency projects at our sites around the world, and have remained the largest purchaser of green power in  
the U.S. for eight years. Due to the increasing complexity of our manufacturing processes, we face ongoing challenges in our efforts to meet our aggressive 2020 hazardous waste recycling and water use goals, but  are committed to looking for innovative solutions in these areas.
I¡¯m proud that we are on track to achieve our 2016  goal to validate that our broader product base is free of tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold derived from sources that benefit armed groups that exploit mine workers to fund violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining regions. This achievement is the result of our eight-year effort to develop systems to ensure that these so-called ¡°conflict-minerals¡± do not enter our supply chain.
We launched our new Diversity and Inclusion initiative in early 2015, setting a bold hiring and retention goal to achieve full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in Intel¡¯s U.S. workforce  by 2020. We committed $300 million to support this  goal and accelerate diversity and inclusion both at Intel and across the technology industry. I¡¯m incredibly proud that a thorough compensation analysis in 2015 showed that we are at 100% gender pay parity for U.S. employees across job types and levels.Through multiple education and digital access initiatives, we are enabling young people to acquire the skills they need to connect to a world of health, economic, and entrepreneurship opportunities. Products such as the new low-power Intel¢ç Curie¢â module are enabling young makers to become the next generation of social innovators. And through our Intel¢ç She Will Connect program, we made progress toward our goal of connecting 5 million women by 2020 to new opportunities through technology.

401,International Flavors and Fragances,1,USA,"With the publication of our 2012 sustainability report, I continue to reflect on our commitment to corporate, social and environmental responsibility.  I cannot presume to know what is right for everyone, only what is right for IFF. And I believe we are on the right path for us to create a lasting influence over how we do business. Our four strategic pillars are built on a foundation that is aligned with the areas that are most material to IFF and our customers. Because of these sound, basic concepts, we see positive tangible and intangible results in our people, our products, our operations, our sourcing and in the way we do business and partner with customers. As we continue on our journey and further our efforts, we keep the Triple Bottom Line in the forefront of our thinking. This means we are taking into consideration what matters most?corporate, social and environmental responsibility?to our shareholders, customers, employees, the millions of consumers whose lives we touch daily around the world, and future generations. Our corporate strategy itself dovetails well with our sustainability program. As we strengthen our innovation platform, we continuously work to design high quality and sustainable products that our customers trust. We do this through green chemistry and with a secure and ethical supply chain. As we leverage our geographic reach, we are conscious of emerging markets¡¯ need to balance economic growth with stewardship of the environment. Therefore, we have incorporated the principles of green design, construction and manufacturing processes at our new facilities. Our mission to maximize our portfolio has us working to increase eco-efficiency today by creating less waste and using less water and energy, and in the future as we create new products. This journey is a balanced one. By working on a global level, we consistently focus on our goals to reduce carbon emissions, waste, and energy and water usage by 20+ percent by 2020. Good business needs good metrics. I believe they are key to confirming that we are on our right path. Over these past few years, we have collected data needed to establish a baseline to which we may compare our efforts, and at a time when global climate change is felt through unprecedented disasters like Hurricane Sandy on the shores of New York and New Jersey or when millions are affected by high air pollution levels in some of the world¡¯s cities, it is up to us as a corporate citizen and as responsible individuals to create a positive impact. It has been said that a jug fills drop by drop. While we may not be the largest company in the world, by keeping a watchful eye on the Triple Bottom Line, we know that our effort, commitment and results matter. I would like to leave you with one final thought, but since this topic is something that is important for all of us at IFF, I will share three with you. One, our sustainability platform is based on facts. We know it¡¯s the right way of doing business, and we will continue to move forward. Two, our global standards are meant to be consistent. Whether you are in Carrollton, Texas, or Delhi, India, you can trust that our methods have been applied the same way around the world. Three, sustainability is increasingly being embedded in the very structure of our company. My vision hasn¡¯t changed for our work with sustainability, but my thinking has?it¡¯s more important than ever to keep this critical approach uppermost in our thought processes at IFF.

402,International Flavors and Fragances,2,USA,"As you will note in the coming pages, IFF¡¯s commitment to sustainability evolves as our company evolves, with the vigor and agility needed to stay relevant in the marketplace of both today and tomorrow. While we understand our industry constantly changes, we remain committed to conducting our business in line with our dedication to the environment, to society and to the shareholders, customers and others who have entrusted their confidence in us. In 2013, we continued to see the future through the challenges that are already facing our global landscape: water scarcity, worldwide climate change, increasing populations around the world, escalating concern for Health and Wellness and the depletion of raw materials. Yet, guided by our four pillar sustainability strategy, we clearly see the benefits of our commitment to environmental stewardship within our own sphere. By improving our products, reducing our impact, sourcing responsibly and engaging our people, our efforts in embedding sustainability into everything we do has moved past the aspirational and into reality. Our accomplishments over these past few years have been rooted in the conscientious alignment of our sustainability strategy with our corporate strategy. As we leverage our geographic reach in the emerging markets, we work to balance economic growth with environmental stewardship by engaging with farmers and other suppliers to grow and nurture natural resources responsibly ? as with our Natural Ethics¢â Vanilla from Madagascar, a sustainable solution that creates value for all stakeholders in the supply chain. As we execute against our capital investments, our Triple Bottom Line philosophy ensures that our new facilities, as with our site in Guangzhou, China, are equipped with state-of-the-art environmental management systems that support our eco-efficiency performance goals. We are also reinvesting in our existing facilities such as in Hazlet, New Jersey, with the construction of the largest photovoltaic solar installation in the flavors and fragrances industry. The very nature of strengthening our innovation platform ensures that we find new and better ways to meet customer demands, as we did with our award-winning LMR Rose Essential¢â, an ultra-concentrated waterless alternative to traditional rose water. As we look to maximize our portfolio through green technology, we strive to develop products that create less waste and use less water and energy, without compromising the consumer experience. Lasting change does not happen with a top-down approach and it is only through focused collaboration that we are experiencing our notable progress. Our people are leading the charge on this. Through our IFF Green Teams, employees are continually organizing around our corporate responsibility efforts. In addition to working on efficiency measures within the organization, our Green Teams focus on our operational processes and work to bring our global strategy to the local level. To date, 75 percent of IFF¡¯s manufacturing facilities have these teams working diligently to increase efficiency. This has a direct benefit to our customers. As we move to reinvent our products, our customers have presented us with both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge has inspired us to further push ourselves to rise to the expectations of our customers and the desires of consumers. We are creating efficient high-quality products that help us minimize the impact on our customers¡¯ supply chain. This opportunity has helped us to innovate new and better methods to execute our business effectively, while keeping the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we are located as top priorities. Ultimately, our mission is to create taste and scent experiences people love in a sustainable manner. Our sustainability efforts are helping us make better business decisions that support a better world ? environmentally, socially and economically. I am pleased with our accomplishments thus far, but it is the future that I look to with anticipation as we keep sustainability uppermost in our thoughts and actions.

We launched our corporate values of passion, creativity, expertise and empowerment. And we significantly progressed against our sustainability strategy established in 2011. What has remained consistent, however, is our steadfast commitment to embedding sustainability throughout our enterprise and operations. When IFF first enacted its formalized sustainability program we were already ahead of the game. Since our founding in 1889, the Company has been a solid corporate citizen concerned with the well-being of the environments in which we operate and of our people who come to work each day. We functioned with efficiency, safety and resource preservation as integral components of our operations while creating exceptional flavors and fragrances for our 
rose products and earning the 2014 For Life Social Responsibility certification in 2014. The sustainability of our products is of utmost importance to us. Last year, we trained IFF chemists and engineers throughout the world on green chemistry to promote biodegradability and renewability, reduce waste and improve our energy efficiency. In order to track product improvements, we developed a proprietary tool to measure and benchmark these efforts so we can confidently calculate our progress for the future. By tapping into the passion of our employees and empowering them to continually innovate, we have established Green Teams in all of our major manufacturing sites. These employee-driven teams are extremely well positioned to drive cultural and environmental advances throughout our operations. 
customers. These focal points are the foundation of our four strategic sustainability pillars and have been strengthened to the point where sustainability touches everything we do. Yet today, like so many of our partners and customers, we are faced with pervasive mega trends that cannot be overlooked: global climate change, water scarcity, increasing world populations and health and wellness needs. And increasingly, customers and consumers are calling for responsible products from responsible companies throughout the supply chain. Our sustainability strategy is an exciting roadmap that addresses these dynamics as we become a more efficient, progressive company. To that extent, our sourcing pillar was established to ensure responsible sourcing from our suppliers around the world, such as in Madagascar, where farmers are growing high-quality, fully traceable vanilla beans used in our Natural Ethics¢â vanilla. What is equally beneficial for the community is how this partnership supported the creation of a local primary school. Another prime example is IFF-LMR Naturals working with farmers in Turkey to produce pure, high-quality 
What is perhaps one of the most exciting developments to date is that we have already reached and exceeded our original 2020 goal of reducing our water usage by 25 percent. To continue to lead in this area, we have now redefined that commitment to reach an overall 50 percent reduction by 2020. This bold goal clearly shows our dedication to reducing our water usage as well as our overall environmental footprint while successfully growing our business. We are also particularly proud to have been recognized by the CDP by inclusion in the 2014 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. Our achievements to date are undoubtedly significant. Yet in 2015 we will refresh our 2020  vision and open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Fortified with the experience we have gained so far,  the future will no doubt result in bolder, more innovative outcomes as we continue to embed sustainability within our corporate strategy, our culture and into everything we do.

Yet today, like so many of our partners and customers, we are faced with pervasive mega trends that cannot be overlooked: global climate change, water scarcity, increasing world populations and health and wellness needs. And increasingly, customers and consumers are calling for responsible products from responsible companies throughout the supply chain. Our sustainability strategy is an exciting roadmap that addresses these dynamics as we become a more efficient, progressive company. To that extent, our sourcing pillar was established to ensure responsible sourcing from our suppliers around the world, such as in Madagascar, where farmers are growing high-quality, fully traceable vanilla beans used in our Natural Ethics¢â vanilla. What is equally beneficial for the community is how this partnership supported the creation of a local primary school. Another prime example is IFF-LMR Naturals working with farmers in Turkey to produce pure, high-quality 
What is perhaps one of the most exciting developments to date is that we have already reached and exceeded our original 2020 goal of reducing our water usage by 25 percent. To continue to lead in this area, we have now redefined that commitment to reach an overall 50 percent reduction by 2020. This bold goal clearly shows our dedication to reducing our water usage as well as our overall environmental footprint while successfully growing our business. We are also particularly proud to have been recognized by the CDP by inclusion in the 2014 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. Our achievements to date are undoubtedly significant. Yet in 2015 we will refresh our 2020  vision and open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Fortified with the experience we have gained so far,  the future will no doubt result in bolder, more innovative outcomes as we continue to embed sustainability within our corporate strategy, our culture and into everything we do.

597,International Flavors and Fragances,4,USA,"IFF advances to meet the needs of today while embracing our role as stewards of tomorrow.  We boldly push our commitment to sustainability by challenging our own boundaries. 2015 was a testament to our progressiveness and forwardthinking as sustainable leaders within our industry. In addition to the advancements we made within our own business, we collaborated with like-minded partners in support of a more sustainable, unified future. In this landmark year, we executed with inspiration and perseverance against our 2011 strategy and advanced it to the next phase.  This was particularly evident when we established sustainability as an enabler of our Vision 2020 business strategy, embedding sustainability deeper into our company and throughout our culture. Our four strategic pillars???sourcing, impact, products and people???help steer our efforts to address the global trends that affect us all. Climate change, water scarcity, increasing world populations and the health and wellness needs of millions touch our business, employees, customers and consumers. Globally, with the enhanced focus on healthy products and responsible sourcing practices, we are working to transform these trends into opportunities. Last year, we achieved the CDP Climate ¡°A¡± List rating with a perfect score of 100 in disclosure and an ¡°A¡± in performance. Additionally, we attained gold status with EcoVadis, a corporate social responsibility rating system that assesses suppliers in sustainable business practices.  IFF was not the only one who had a landmark year. The global community made great strides at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21). I attended the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) forum at the Paris Climate Conference to demonstrate IFF¡¯s support and stood with nearly 200 other leading businesses. Along with a cross-section of the world¡¯s prominent business, political and NGO leaders, we celebrated the approval of a comprehensive worldwide climate agreement. By formalizing IFF¡¯s support on this vital measure, we added this partnership to the cadre of significant initiatives we joined this past year, including the United Nations Global Compact and the American Business Act on Climate Pledge.  It is my belief that as industry leaders, we have an unyielding commitment to the Earth. In 2015, we reaffirmed our commitment to renewable energy???notably and formally with our support of RE100, a collaborative, global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. In addition to having the largest solar array in the flavors and fragrances industry in Hazlet, New Jersey, we broke ground on the industry¡¯s first on-site wind turbine at our Tilburg, Netherlands facility. Once completed, the windmill is estimated to provide up to 30 percent of the site¡¯s electricity needs???and when combined with the green electricity we are purchasing, Tilburg will be powered on 100 percent green electricity by mid-2016.
We also further enhanced our sustainable sourcing practices. We pioneered industry-leading membership in the Together for Sustainability sourcing initiative and earned For Life social responsibility certification for our naturals: ylangylang, patchouli and basil from Madagascar, and vetiver from Haiti. We progressed our 2020 sustainability goals by obtaining Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil process certification at many of our facilities, and achieving year-over-year company-wide reductions in our water use, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions intensities.  Yet, it is only through the engagement of our employees that these achievements are realized. Our safety performance has steadily improved - with our total recordable incident rate decreasing each year since 2011. Our Green Teams are active at every manufacturing facility???and a number of our creative centers?? and fuel our passion for advancement by putting action behind our aspirations. I thank them deeply for their efforts. 
At  IFF, our pioneering spirit helps us answer the questions of tomorrow, and inspires a limitless vision on our ability to lead transformational change. This will continue in 2016 with the launch of a more ambitious sustainability vision that will reinforce our growth and acceleration within our environmental framework. As with all aspects of business, evolution is the only true option???and our work in sustainability is no different. Yes, being environmentally responsive makes good business sense, but even more than that???it is the right thing to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
404,International Paper,3,USA,"On behalf of International Paper¡¯s 58,000 employees worldwide, I am proud to present our 2014 sustainability plans and results. For more than 117 years, International Paper¡¯s commitment to the highest ethical and sustainable business standards is guided by a simple principle: do the right things for the right reasons. We strive to make the right decisions for our employees, customers, neighbors, and investors? which have allowed us to continuously improve our social, environmental, and economic performance. As Chairman and CEO, I have the pleasure of seeing our efforts  firsthand and look forward to sharing these with you over  the next few pages. As a global manufacturer operating in more than 24 countries, natural resources are crucial to our supply chain. This is why we are continuously working to improve all aspects of our value chain, especially sourcing of wood fiber, water use, and energy efficiency. In 2012 we created 12 voluntary sustainability goals to measure our performance with  specific targets set for 2020. We have already exceeded several of these goals and we¡¯re committed and focused  on achieving the others.
¡°International Paper is guided by a simple principle embedded in  The IP Way: do the right things for the right reasons.¡± Over the past few years, we have worked with internal and external stakeholders to identify key issues that  are material to our global operations. The process led  to the update of our sustainability strategy in 2014,  which prioritizes six key sustainability areas. We believe a sharp focus on the following priority areas will help us continue to move in the right direction on some of the most critical issues for our company and the communities in which we operate. 
 
 Safety: Eliminating fatalities and injuries in our workplace is our highest priority. Our Life-Changing Injury and Fatality Elimination (LIFE) safety program has reduced life-impacting injuries by 68 percent since its inception. In 2015, leaders at all levels of the company will receive IP Safety Leadership training. Water Use: Recognizing the growing importance of global water usage, we¡¯ve mapped all 41 of our mills based on water-related risk to help identify water conservation opportunities. Looking forward, we will create site-specific plans for strategic watershed areas to reduce our water use in water-stressed locations. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: In our primary mills we use renewable carbon neutral biomass to meet nearly 70 percent of our energy needs. Since 2010 we have reduced GHGs by 8.3 percent and improved energy efficiency by 6.1 percent. Forest Stewardship: Forests are the largest source of our raw materials. Our focus on forest stewardship essentially guarantees all our fiber comes from responsibly managed forests, and that ecological benefits will be available for generations to come. 
Since 2010 we have increased our certified fiber by almost 28 percent and will continue to strive toward our goal of a 35 percent increase by 2020.  Ethics and Compliance: Ethical behavior and personal integrity are at the core of our culture. These values extend beyond our employees to our suppliers, who are required to maintain the same level of ethics and integrity in their dealings with us. In 2014 we expanded the number of suppliers trained in our Supplier Code of Conduct and obtained commitments of compliance from the vast majority of suppliers. Over the next few years we intend to enhance our processes and expand our ability to  hold our suppliers accountable to the commitments into the future. Stakeholder Engagement: By engaging our stakeholders we are building trust and credibility  to create advocates for our great company. As a company we¡¯re committed to continuous improvement and transparency around our sustainability successes and challenges. The stories ahead represent IP¡¯s diverse efforts around the world to move us closer to our goals. I hope you will see why we believe sustainability is simply In Our Nature.

598,International Paper,4,USA,"How do you balance sustainable business  practices with the pressure to meet investors¡¯ financial expectations?
We don¡¯t believe we need to choose between operating responsibly and generating profits ?  they go hand-in-hand.  
We strive to do the right things, in the right ways, for the right reasons. This governs everything we do ? from our relationships with people and communities, to our impact on the planet, to ensuring our businesses are successful and sustainable for generations to come.
By operating in a sustainable way, we demonstrate we are a trusted supplier that customers can depend on, a valued investment for our shareowners, a company where people are proud to work, and a force for good in our industry and communities.
Our commitment to do the right thing is embedded in our day-to-day operations and governed at the highest level of our company, where our Board  of Director¡¯s Public Policy and Environment Committee maintains thoughtful oversight of the company¡¯s global citizenship, health, safety, and environmental policies. 
QTell us about the Company¡¯s progress on its  sustainability goals.
In short, we¡¯re right on track. We established our Vision 2020 Goals to focus on improving our environmental impact and promoting the sustainability of key natural resources. We use the GRI reporting framework to guide  data collection, measure our progress, and share the results.   
At the midway point of our Vision 2020 plan, our results are consistent and strong. We surpassed our water quality and air emission targets and are on track to achieve our greenhouse gas emissions goal ahead of schedule. We also continue to make good progress increasing our use of third-party-certified fiber, reducing the amount of fiber lost in our manufacturing processes, and decreasing the amount of solid waste sent to landfills.
Safety is one area where our results are mixed ? it¡¯s our top priority and toughest challenge. In 2015, 93 percent of our facilities operated without a serious injury and we have reduced serious injuries by 60 percent in the past  five years. However, we must eliminate incidents that result in employee and contractor fatalities. In order to accomplish this goal, we are focused on ensuring safe working conditions and behaviors and setting the expectation that nothing we do is more important than people¡¯s lives. 
What are the challenges that influence your  sustainability priorities?
We sort our key challenges into five categories:
? Ensuring the safety of all employees, contractors,  and visitors ? Attracting, developing, and retaining talent ? Balancing the needs of all stakeholders ? Competing successfully and sustainably in maturedemand, commodity product segments ? Engaging our supply chain partners to operate according to The IP Way We have ongoing initiatives that support our responsibility to ensure the success of our company, the health of the planet, and well-being of our colleagues and neighbors. 
QWhy is talking about global citizenship  important to you?
It¡¯s one of our core values ? we have a strong commitment to operating responsibly and sustainably, and we always appreciate the opportunity to describe our goals and success, and even sometimes to set the record straight. For example, we need to correct a common misconception about our industry ? that using less paper will save trees. Just the opposite is true ? demand for paper and paperbased packaging provides the economic catalyst for landowners to keep their lands forested and maintain the long-term health of the world¡¯s forest. As a matter of fact, growth has exceeded removals for more  than 50 years. 
Energy consumption is another area where I want people to understand the way we operate ? more than 70 percent of the energy used in our mill system is generated from carbon-neutral, renewable biomass rather than fossil fuels.
Ultimately, when people think about International Paper, I want them to know that we transform renewable resources into recyclable products that people depend on every day.  
We produce:
? Packaging products that protect goods and enable world-wide commerce ? Pulp for tissue, diapers and other personal hygiene products ? Papers that facilitate education and communication ? Paper bags that carry groceries ? Cups and food containers for quick-service meals 
I want our stakeholders to understand our commitment to safe, sustainable operations and how we work to reduce our environmental impact and increase our contributions to society.How has your approach to sustainability  changed over time?
Our vision for IP is to be among the most successful, sustainable, and responsible companies in the world. To pursue that vision, we have elevated Global Citizenship to a more strategic level.  
We continue to improve our environmental footprint,  which is largely the focus of this report. We are also increasing our handprint ? the positive impact we create for our stakeholders, our industry, and our planet. Our handprint initiatives foster the long-term sustainability of our company.
Many of our handprint initiatives involve strategic partners, like our five-year Forestland Stewards partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to restore forests in the Southeastern United States. Another great example is our community outreach, which was recognized by the American Red Cross during the historic flooding in South Carolina. We donated $750,000 and 10,000 boxes to provide critical disaster relief to thousands  of impacted families.   
I am proud to represent International Paper and appreciate the opportunity to update you on our global citizenship progress. You¡¯ll find additional details in this report and in our company overview, which is available at internationalpaper.com.

405,Johnson & Johnson,2,USA,"Our commitment to citizenship and sustainability at Johnson & Johnson is inspired by what was written more than 70 years ago in Our Credo. To this day Our Credo serves as the compass that guides all decisions at our Company.  Our Credo defines our responsibilities to all stakeholders and to the communities in which we work and live.
Health care is one of the greatest challenges facing society now and in the future. No other issue is as important or personal to every individual, every family, every community and every country. As the world¡¯s largest and most diverse health care company, we feel it is our responsibility to lead in the development of a comprehensive and collaborative global approach to this challenge, and to continue pursuing our aspiration to help billions of people around the world live longer, healthier and happier lives. 
In working to meet this worldwide challenge, our Citizenship & Sustainability priorities are to advance human health and well-being, help to safeguard the planet, and lead a dynamic and growing business responsibly. This is the citizenship and sustainability 
framework through which we strive to continue the  good progress we have made against our Healthy Future 2015 goals:
  We continue to expand our efforts and engage in collaborative projects to advance global health on multiple levels. In 2010, we made a significant fiveyear commitment to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to improve the lives of women and children worldwide, and we are on track to deliver our commitments by 2015.
  Our newly formed Janssen Global Public Health (GPH) team combines the best of our innovative access models with our core business strategy to drive better outcomes, improve quality of life and sustainably advance health care. GPH¡¯s work with the Stop TB Partnership to facilitate access to SIRTURO¢â (bedaquiline), the first medication for pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis with a novel mechanism of action in over  40 years, will have a major impact on lives. We will continue these and other efforts in response to the world¡¯s health challenges.
  We are leading a dynamic and responsible business in many ways. As part of our longstanding practices and commitment to Citizenship & Sustainability, we joined the U.N. Global Compact in 2013 and are committed to its 
principles, many of which have been embedded in our business practices for decades. 
  We are conscientious, too, of our impact on the environment, the health of which is inextricably linked to our efforts in human health. In 2013, our energy and carbon reduction programs earned distinction from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), naming us as the health care sector leader within the S&P 500 and maintaining our membership in the CDP Leadership Index for the fourth consecutive year.
Our 2013 Successes and Challenges are outlined on pages 4?8 of this report. Detailed progress against our Healthy Future 2015 goals is provided beginning on page 89. 
In planning for the longer term, we have completed our second Citizenship & Sustainability materiality assessment considering the ways we impact the world socially, environmentally and economically, or that can be linked to our activities and results of relationships with others. The results of this assessment are considered in the topics covered in this report and will inform our next round of five-year goal setting.  
Looking Ahead
We work and live in a world challenged by a growing number of diseases, aging populations, insufficient health care delivery and rising costs. We also see tremendous opportunities to innovate and believe in the power of collaboration to find and deliver new solutions to serve the individuals, families, communities, countries and shareholders that depend on us.  
  Health care needs throughout the world are evolving rapidly. Our decentralized management approach gives us an important perspective on the needs of communities in which we live and work and ways to focus our Citizenship & Sustainability efforts to make a difference locally and globally. 
  We want to ensure all of our products are designed, developed, manufactured, and distributed to the right quality and compliance standards. As a part of that effort and in connection with our complex supply chain system, we are working to strengthen our influence over the sourcing of materials, ensure adequate working conditions at our suppliers¡¯ facilities, support diversity among our suppliers, and understand and take action to shape the ways in which our suppliers contribute to our environmental and social impacts. 
  We recognize the continued interest in increased transparency by companies and honor our commitment to enhanced transparency. 
  We collaborate with thousands of partners, including academic institutions, governments, NGOs, thought leaders, competitors and communities around the world to help maximize the impact of our efforts through networks and shared learning. 
For 128 years Johnson & Johnson has pursued and delivered transformative solutions to challenges in health and well-being. Our Credo reflects the character, ethics and values that define us and sets out the responsibilities of a strong, innovative, growing and sustainable global organization in the 21st century. 
Around the world we are doing important work to advance human health and well-being, help to safeguard the planet, and lead a dynamic and growing business responsibly. As we approach the future and consider our next set of five-year Citizenship & Sustainability goals, we will do so boldly, actively seeking out new solutions that advance health, wellness and improve the quality of people¡¯s lives.

406,Johnson & Johnson,3,USA,"Our mission at Johnson & Johnson is to help people live longer, healthier and happier lives. Our Credo defines our responsibilities to: the patients and consumers we serve, our employees, the communities in which we live and work, and to our shareholders. Our citizenship and sustainability practices are an important part of those responsibilities, and we take this work very seriously. 
Our Citizenship & Sustainability approach is consistent with our framework of strategic principles and growth drivers for managing the business.  Our strategic approach to Citizenship & Sustainability spans three areas?Advancing Human Health and Well-Being, Stewarding a Healthy Environment, and Leading a Dynamic and Growing Business Responsibly. This approach provides a framework for our goals and efforts on topics identified in our materiality assessment as well as those of greatest interest to both Johnson & Johnson and our stakeholders. Specifically, these reflect our significant economic, environmental and social impacts, and those that could substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholdersAdvancing Global Health and Well-Being
As part of our longstanding commitment to global health, we work with our partners to develop innovative approaches to advance research and development and develop sustainable access for our medicines. Collaboration is the engine of innovation at Johnson & Johnson. In response to the Ebola crisis, we are working with consortia of nongovernmental organizations, national research programs and industry partners to accelerate and significantly expand the Ebola vaccine program in development at our Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies. We also work with Stop TB Partnership¡¯s Global Drug Facility and with the U.S. Agency for International Development to expand access to our multi-drug resistant tuberculosis compound, SIRTURO¢ç (bedaquiline). We have expanded our collaboration with the International Partnership for Microbicides for the worldwide development and commercialization of dapivirine, which is designed for the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV in women. 
Stewarding a Healthy Environment  
Throughout our Corporation, we work to reduce energy consumption while increasing the proportion of energy we use from renewable sources. Five years ago, we established a goal to significantly increase on-site renewable and clean-technology energy capacity, and we have met that goal. We continue to look for ways to reduce water consumption and waste across the product development process. Our commitment five years ago to integrate and expand our Earthwards¢ç approach to drive continuous sustainability improvements and innovation across our products is exceeding expectations. Our Healthy Future 2015 goal is to have 60 Earthwards¢ç-recognized products by year-end 2015. We have achieved and exceeded this goal a year early, with a total of 73 products having achieved this recognition as of the end of 2014. 
Leading a Dynamic and Growing Business Responsibly 
As a part of our Citizenship & Sustainability efforts, we remain committed to enhanced transparency and increased engagement with stakeholders. In January 2015, we announced an extended agreement with the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) Project to provide access to our portfolio of medical devices products, setting new industry standards by being the first company to do so. This followed an initial agreement with YODA for our pharmaceutical products in 2014. We¡¯re proud of our ongoing efforts to improve the health of women and children, which include the work we do with our partners in support of the  UN Millennium Development Goals. In the past year alone, we¡¯ve reached more than 88 million women and children, on our way to meeting our goal of reaching 120 million women and children with our efforts. In addition, in 2014 we expanded programs using mobile technology to communicate vital health information to new and expectant mothers in South Africa and India. And we announced a global partnership with Save the Children that aims to help improve the survival and healthy development of millions of children under age five over the next three years.
These are just a few of our successes and some of the progress we¡¯ve made against our Healthy Future 2015 goals. 
Facing Broader Trends with Strength and Leadership
Providing sustainable, high-quality health care is one of the world¡¯s greatest challenges. The historic aging rate of the world¡¯s population brings dramatically greater demand for higher-quality health care, and governments and health systems must manage this with increasingly strained resources. 
3 The world today requires the very best that  Johnson & Johnson has to offer, and we are constantly striving to innovate and lead. As the largest and most diversified healthcare company, we have both the privilege and responsibility to help meet global health challenges with boldness, vision and a driving sense of purpose.
We have defined our purpose at Johnson & Johnson as caring for the world, one person at a time.  I truly believe this inspires everything we do. I am confident in our continued ability to care as no  other company can.

599,Johnson & Johnson,4,USA,"For 130 years Johnson & Johnson has been helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. Written nearly 75 years ago,  Our Credo guides everything we do with a strong sense of responsibility, inspiration and a clear measure of accountability. Our Credo outlines our commitments to the people, places and communities we touch every day with our products and solutions, and informs our strategic approach to our Citizenship & Sustainability efforts.
At Johnson & Johnson, we aspire to improve health in all we do, and everywhere we go. Since the launch of our Healthy Future 2015 goals in 2010 we have worked to advance global health; steward a healthy environment; increase sustainability among our suppliers; foster the most engaged, health-conscious and safe employees in the world; advance community wellness; enhance outcome measurement in philanthropy; and increase transparency and collaboration. We met most of our goals and, in so doing, helped even more people and deepened our relationships with our stakeholders. Our performance is presented in this report and highlighted in Successes and Opportunities. 
upon Also in 2015, we expanded the ways we think about health and sought new ways to make everyone, everywhere, healthier as we finalized our new Citizenship & Sustainability 2020 Goals, described in detail within this report. Our Citizenship & Sustainability 2020 Goals continue our legacy of work to advance healthier societies and will help more people live healthier lives through the ideas we generate, products we make, and good habits and practices we create. These new goals have three key focus areas:
 
?   People: We will help people be healthier by providing better access and care in more places around the world. ?   Places: We will make the places we live, work and play healthier by using fewer and smarter resources. ?   Practices: We will team up with partners and employees to further advance our culture of health and well-being. 
We believe we can use our expertise, influence, global reach and partnerships to help make this world a healthier, better place. We are acutely aware of the dramatically changing global healthcare market. Populations of developed nations are aging rapidly and intractable diseases are taking hold in some developing countries, increasing healthcare costs; middle classes are expanding in many developing nations, putting pressure on existing healthcare infrastructure and capacity; and patients are becoming increasingly involved in their own healthcare decisions, necessitating a holistic approach to meeting their needs by integrating wellness solutions, innovative new medicines and advanced technologies. We believe the most important contribution we can make to the dynamic challenges we are facing is innovation?innovation in products and solutions, services, processes and practices. The promise of innovation in health care is great, but it comes with the need for forward-focused investment in R&D, a holistic approach to evolving global healthcare markets and bold future-facing strategies that build 
upon our proven strategic principles.  In developing our new Citizenship & Sustainability 2020 Goals we have broadened our view to consider not just the challenges of the business we are in, but of the world in which we operate. Global trends that could impact our ability to help people and the environment be healthier include: population growth, poverty and inequality, rising global instability, climate change, water and resource scarcity, human rights issues, and pressures to increase transparency.  These and many other global challenges are recognized within the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ratified in late 2015. The SDGs provide a comprehensive framework for governments, NGOs, private sector and other entities to consider in their strategic plans moving forward. Later in 2016 we will provide a perspective on the role we can play in addressing the SDGs. As the world¡¯s largest, broadly based healthcare company, guided as we are by Our Credo, we are committed to fulfill our unique opportunity to help billions of people live longer, healthier, happier lives today, and for generations to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
408,JPMorgan Chase,1,USA,"five years after the global financial crisis began, 2012 saw the economic tide begin to turn. The U.S. housing market started to stabilize, economies around the world slowly found their footing and unemployment rates inched down.  
At JPMorgan Chase, we remain optimistic that better days are ahead, but far too many people are looking for jobs, governments are facing severe fiscal constraints and vital social service providers are stretched thin trying to serve millions struggling to make ends meet. 
As the financial crisis in the U.S. and the ongoing challenges in Europe have demonstrated, the world is more complex and our economies more interconnected than at any time in history. Populations are growing rapidly and are migrating to urban areas, creating the need for new jobs and putting pressure on local infrastructure, public services and natural resources. And political instability, fueled in part by lack of economic opportunity, is sending ripples around the globe. 
At the core of our values, JPMorgan Chase believes that using our strength and global reach, our expertise and relationships and, of course, our access to capital to support our clients and communities, invest in them and help them navigate a complex global economy is our unique and fundamental corporate responsibility. This is central to how we do business. Because when we are successful, we create the foundation for widely shared growth and long-term prosperity. 2012 Results There was a lot for us to be proud of during the last year. At a time when job creation  is top of mind, we increased our lending to small businesses by 18% over 2011; provided  $6 billion to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities through our community development work; and worked to improve the lives of underserved people around the globe by growing our impact investment portfolio to nearly $50 million.
We also worked with municipal governments to finance investments in infrastructure, education and economic development that make cities globally competitive ? and we leveraged our global footprint to connect economic leaders around the world through our Global Cities Initiative with The Brookings Institution. We advanced environmental stewardship and innovation across our lines of business in close partnership with clients and through careful management of our direct operations. Our company and people donated significant amounts of time and money to help local charities everywhere we operate. And we continued to uphold our duty to support the military men and women who bravely serve the U.S. 
Taken together, these efforts reflect our responsibility to invest in our communities across the globe ? and we are committed to doing more in the years ahead. We know that to make progress, we need to operate with integrity, acknowledge and fix our mistakes, and continually strive to gain the confidence of all our stakeholders. This is what motivates us every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
409,JPMorgan Chase,2,USA,"But a host of challenges persist, and there is an urgent need to ?nd solutions that create greater economic opportunity for more people. 
Companies like JPMorgan Chase have a responsibility to be part of the solution, not only because it¡¯s the right thing to do but because our own long-term success depends on the success of our communities and the people, companies and institutions we serve. 
In the past, most corporations found it suf?cient to ful?ll this responsibility by simply donating money to charities. But today, we recognize that spurring greater economic growth and employment requires much more than writing checks. At a time when public sector resources are increasingly constrained, there is a compelling need for the private sector to do even more ? in our case, by putting our ?nancial expertise in the service of broader community needs. We are at our best when our core business helps communities thrive.
To be sure, the ?nancial resources that ?rms provide are critical, but they are only one of many assets we can bring to bear. We can help make a difference by leveraging the skills, technology, data and expertise we use to drive our own business and by applying these assets to meet the global challenges that impact our communities. When we do this, we think our company can make a truly meaningful contribution, but we know that we are only one part of the solution. The challenges are complex, and ?nding solutions requires tapping into the expertise of individuals and organizations with a range of different perspectives, skills and capabilities. Strong partnerships and robust engagement among the public, private and nonpro?t sectors are increasingly essential. 
At JPMorgan Chase, corporate responsibility always has been central to how we do business, starting with operating with integrity in all we do and extending to all the ways we help our clients and communities navigate a complex global economy. We strive to develop innovative programs that leverage the core strengths, capabilities and expertise of our business and our people ? and those of our partners ? to maximize our impact. We are very proud of what we accomplished in 2013. 
Tremendous progress has been made in recent decades to address many of the world¡¯s most pressing social, economic and environmental problems. 
2013 RESULTS To help reduce unemployment and expand economic opportunity, we launched New Skills at Work, an unprecedented $250 million, ?ve-year initiative aimed at helping close the skills gap around the world. The effort brings together our resources and capabilities with those of proven partners to help address the mismatch between the skills available in the workforce and those that employers need in order to grow their business. 
Ongoing global health challenges presented another opportunity to work with great partners to launch a groundbreaking initiative. In partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we created the Global Health Investment Fund to attract private capital into an investment vehicle with the potential to save millions of lives in low-income countries. 
And there are many more examples of our work over the last year. JPMorgan Chase has collaborated with best-in-class partners to address the unique challenges military and veterans face in employment, education and housing; to help metro areas create global trade strategies through our Global Cities Initiative with the Brookings Institution; and to advance environmental stewardship and spur innovation across our business in partnership with our clients. And we roll up our sleeves to support these and other initiatives ? last year, our employees provided more than 540,000 hours of volunteer service in local communities around the globe.
While there is much we were proud of during 2013, we know there is much more work to be done. The more we can break down the traditional barriers among the public, private and nonpro?t sectors, the more we can achieve for our communities. It is a tall order, but JPMorgan Chase is profoundly optimistic about how much can be accomplished when people come together to do extraordinary things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
410,JPMorgan Chase,3,USA,"Sarah Rosen Wartell: A 2014 Gallup poll showed that Americans¡¯ views of your industry are improving, but the banking industry still has significant work to do to return to pre-financial crisis trust levels. What is different about JPMorgan Chase today, compared with a few years ago?
Jamie Dimon: Our firm was a port of safety during the financial crisis ? and we¡¯ll be one in the next storm ? but that doesn¡¯t mean there weren¡¯t things we needed to fix. We are steadfast in our commitment to learn from our mistakes. I know the public is angry, and I think they have a right to be. Therefore, we should acknowledge that and continue to work to fix the problems in the financial system. And at JPMorgan Chase, we are trying to do our part to do just that. 
Our firm has undertaken a massive effort to strengthen our control environment and continue to strengthen our corporate culture as well. Last year, we published a report called ¡°How We Do Business ? The Report¡± that details those efforts, and I¡¯d encourage everyone to read it. Perhaps most important, the report talks about our people and our culture and what we¡¯re doing to hold ourselves and each other accountable for adhering to our values and standards every day, in everything we do. 
This commitment to accountability and transparency isn¡¯t limited to our business operations; we¡¯re applying it to our corporate responsibility efforts as well. 
Sarah Rosen Wartell: JPMorgan Chase has taken an unusual stand in its corporate responsibility ? bringing in a partner to learn what¡¯s working and what¡¯s not. Why invite that scrutiny and be open to that level of transparency? 
Jamie Dimon: We have a number of significant corporate responsibility initiatives ? I¡¯d point to our work  in Detroit and on workforce readiness as two key examples ? but they all have the same fundamental objective: to use our expertise, resources and data to support economic growth and expand access to various opportunities in our communities. I believe there are no more urgent, important or morally compelling challenges facing the world today. So our firm is working hard to help find solutions that create more jobs, grow small businesses, give people the skills to compete in the workforce and, ultimately, create more widely shared prosperity. 
Over the next five years, we will deploy $1 billion toward these efforts, and we want to be certain these investments achieve meaningful impact. We want to be judged not on the commitments we make or the amount of money we give, but on our effectiveness in helping solve real challenges and improving people¡¯s lives. So we are taking a disciplined, data-driven approach to make sure we fully understand the nature of the challenges, support the most effective solutions and work with best-in-class partners to get things done. We also expect to learn along the way.
That¡¯s why we are looking forward to our collaboration with the Urban Institute. The deep expertise and insight your organization will bring to analyzing the impact of our efforts will strengthen our programs and, we think, provide valuable learning for others. 
Sarah Rosen Wartell: What does JPMorgan Chase see as the most promising strategies for creating more broadly shared economic opportunity? 
Jamie Dimon: With millions of people around the world migrating to urban areas, strengthening local economies is essential to opening up access to opportunity, and that¡¯s why we¡¯re focused on working with local leaders to develop strategies that boost the economic vitality of cities. 
One specific area where our firm is placing a big bet is on helping cities close their skills gaps. We think this can make a real difference in expanding access to opportunity, shrinking the income gap a bit and giving the whole economy a boost. 
City leaders and employers tell us they are looking for better data to help them align workforce training programs with the skills and credentials employers need. So one of the things we¡¯re doing is developing real-time, locally focused labor market data in cities across the United States and in Europe to help everyone better target efforts on sectors and occupations where jobs ? particularly those that pay good wages and offer opportunities for advancement ? are going unfilled. 
We¡¯re also supporting youth employment programs. One of the biggest sins in our country is that half of inner city school kids do not graduate from high school. That¡¯s a massive waste of potential ? and virtually guarantees that those kids won¡¯t be able to break the cycle of poverty. Research shows that teenagers who have summer jobs are more likely to stay in school and to have higher earnings into adulthood. But there¡¯s a serious shortage of positions ? particularly for kids in economically distressed communities, where the need is greatest ? so we¡¯re helping those programs expand. 
Sarah Rosen Wartell: What is the private sector¡¯s role in addressing big societal challenges like economic opportunity and inequality? 
Jamie Dimon: There is a moral obligation, first and foremost, but the private sector also has a clear vested interest in doing so. The long-term success of our firm ? of any company ? is inextricably linked to the health and vitality of the communities and customers we serve. Creating more jobs, strengthening the educational system, fixing immigration, growing middle class incomes ? these are not only in society¡¯s interest, they¡¯re also in our  firm¡¯s interest. 
In the past, there¡¯s been a view by many that the private sector¡¯s primary contribution was financial. That¡¯s clearly still part of the equation, but there¡¯s a recognition today that finding transformative, lasting solutions also requires the expertise, tools and innovation capacity of the private sector. And it requires new kinds of partnerships among the public, private and nonprofit sectors. 
Clearly, our firm is just one part of the solution, but we¡¯re putting our particular resources and capabilities to work in a number of areas. We¡¯re developing new investment models that create social and environmental value alongside financial return such as the Global Health Investment Fund and NatureVest. We¡¯re helping identify and scale innovative solutions to consumer financial challenges through the Financial Solutions Lab. And, in 2015, we are launching the JPMorgan Chase Institute, which will leverage the unique assets of our firm, including our global reach, unique real-time data and intellectual capital, to deliver insight on economic trends around  the world. 
Those are just a few examples ? and we look forward to working with you and other partners to strengthen our communities and create more broadly shared prosperity.

411,Kimberly-Clark,1,USA,"Kimberly-Clark is leading the world in providing essentials for a better life and is committed to doing it sustainably. And we know that innovation is central to our success, whether we¡¯re enhancing our trusted brands or ? nding ways to reduce our impact on the planet. We try to do the right thing for our customers and our world, and we wouldn¡¯t have it any other way. 
For 140 years, Kimberly-Clark has provided essential brands that people know and trust. From humble beginnings producing paper from rag stock at our Neenah, Wisconsin, mill in 1872, today we compete in eight major consumer-market categories, ? ve of which we created. Additionally, people use Kimberly-Clark Professional¡¯s products to provide safety solutions and enhance the quality of the workplace environment. Medical professionals turn to Kimberly-Clark Health Care for a portfolio of products essential to the health and hygiene of their patients and staff. Kimberly-Clark created ? ve of the eight consumer-market categories in which it competes.
Being positive contributors to our communities is a big part of what we do and, for the past 60 years, we¡¯ve provided essentials through the Kimberly-Clark Foundation and many other regional, brand and employee-led initiatives. Last year, we contributed $19 million in cash and $14 million in product donations, in addition to the countless hours our employees spent volunteering in their communities.
For a decade now, we have reported on company-wide environmental, social and economic progress in annual sustainability reports, which for the past several years have also served as our communication on progress to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). 
At Kimberly-Clark, sustainability has always been about doing the right thing. But, more than that, sustainability provides us with several competitive advantages. It earns us a cost advantage through reductions in water and energy use and in waste sent to land? ll, which have saved us tens of millions of dollars over the past 20 years. 
It also secures us a customer advantage. As we¡¯ve found since we began setting goals and reporting our progress against them, great customers want to do business with companies that operate in a transparent, responsible and ethical manner. We¡¯ve also found that, increasingly great people want to work for companies that are committed to environmental and social stewardship. Attracting great people who share similar beliefs is important for our future success, and new talent bring with them new ideas that help us to get better and better. At Kimberly-Clark, we¡¯re continuously improving what we do and how we operate: 
? Advancing innovation through our products. Twenty-two percent of our net sales in 2012 were from environmentally innovative products, including the ? rst alternative ? ber tissue and towel products brought to market containing bamboo and wheat straw. 
? Looking beyond our own footprint to our supply chain. Through our Corporate Social Compliance program, which we rolled out in 2012, we are increasing our con? dence that key suppliers are engaging in continuous improvement towards operating in a sustainable and ethical manner.
? Continually striving to reduce the footprint of our operations and raw materials use. In 2012, we announced our intention to transition at least 50 percent of our wood-? ber demand from natural forests to other ? ber sources by 2025.Supporting our employees through training and development opportunities, safe workplaces and fair labor practices
In 2012, we celebrated achievements in each of our sustainability pillars:
? More than 12,000 salaried and hourly employees in 66 countries collaborated with each other during a ? ve-day, online, global One K-C Culture Jam, contributing internal culture-related ideas that will help us improve employee engagement 
? Introduced safe water initiatives in El Salvador and Colombia that, along with our ongoing water projects in India and Israel, helped us meet our annual water replenishment target of 200 million gallons 
? Yielded revenue of $56 million globally through sales of scrap and secondary materials, more than offsetting total waste disposal costs of $28 million while reducing our footprint 
? Realized more than $1.5 million in energy savings at our El Salvador facility by installing energy monitoring equipment that has enhanced ef? ciency and allowed operators to adjust energy consumption to avoid peak energy prices 
? Reached $100 million in sales of our Scott Naturals product line in just ? ve years, demonstrating the competitiveness of budget-friendly products containing recycled ? ber, including tube-free bath tissue, paper towels and ? ushable cleansing cloths 
While we are pleased with our success, 2012 also had its challenges. We fell short of our goal of zero manufacturing waste to land? ll. Also, many of the products we sell are single-use and, while we broadened the reach of our recycling and composting programs, we still have a lot of work to do in this area. We 
also continued to adjust to new global economic realities, with restructuring in our North American and European operations. We did our best to balance business needs with our social and environmental responsibilities as we closed Kimberly-Clark¡¯s last two remaining pulp mills.
Going forward, we will ? nd creative solutions that reduce our environmental footprint and encourage our suppliers to embrace more sustainable practices. We will also focus on sourcing environmentally preferred alternative materials for our products and ? nding ways to enhance the bene? ts of our philanthropic activities.
As our employees apply their passion and ingenuity to meet the challenges of today and those of tomorrow, I know that together we are acting with the same dedication to quality, service and fairness with which our founders established our business 140 years ago. The world has changed since then. Our dedication to our values and long-term sustainability has not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
412,Kimberly-Clark,3,USA,"Long before sustainability became a topic of widespread interest, KimberlyClark sought to continuously improve the way we run our business, socially, environmentally and economically. This commitment is one of the reasons Kimberly-Clark has earned the trust and respect of people around the world for more than 140 years. 
Our vision to lead the world in the essentials for a better life is not limited to the products we provide. It also calls us to deliver them in ways that prioritize clean air and water, healthy forests and strong communities, while delivering shareholder value.
Our sustainability strategy is helping strengthen our communities and protect our planet, from our 30-year-old employee tree-planting program in Korea and our partnership with Malaria No More in Africa, to our mills throughout the world that eliminate waste and our efforts to identify new sources of fiber for our products. The company connects long-term growth with a need for sustainability, and this connection is a critical element of the progress we¡¯ve made thus far. 
Most importantly, the people of Kimberly-Clark have a strong desire to renew and improve our products, the way we work, and the communities around us, so that our planet and its people can thrive.At Kimberly-Clark, sustainability is an important element of our company¡¯s vision to lead the world in essentials for a better life. To deliver this vision,  we challenge ourselves to create a better future by being responsible  stewards of our shared natural resources, enhancing the lives of those who  use our products and making positive contributions to the communities we touch. We do this while working to deliver superior business results and shareholder returns.  
Our thinking regarding the sustainability of our business has evolved since our founding in 1872, but it is part of our heritage. As we approach the conclusion of our Sustainability 2015 goals, you might be interested in a few of the accomplishments we achieved: 
  Our Supplier Social Compliance Standards (SSCS) are part of KimberlyClark¡¯s workplace accountability programs. In 2014, we continued to make progress on our SSCS goal by increasing key suppliers participating in the program to 87 percent of in-scope suppliers and by expanding the standards to include oversight of conflict minerals and anti-corruption compliance. 
  Kimberly-Clark is committed to advancing positive social change in the communities where we live and work. In 2014 we had active social programs in 97 percent of all Kimberly-Clark communities. We¡¯re also working on initiatives such as our Toilets Change Lives program, which will support local entrepreneurs around the world who are addressing sanitation in a sustainable way. 
  We are committed to reducing our climate impact and are proud  that we achieved a 6.9% percent reduction in our absolute greenhouse  gas emissions in 2014. This exceeded our Sustainability 2015 goal of  5 percent. 
  We¡¯ve exceeded our Sustainability 2015 target for net sales, set at 25 percent, from products in our EcoLogical portfolio.  
  As of the end of 2014, we were diverting over 88 percent of our manufacturing waste from landfills. We also implemented several programs aimed at reducing waste at the end of the product lifecycle.As we¡¯ve been working to deliver against our Sustainability 2015 goals, we¡¯ve also been looking ahead and challenging ourselves to drive even more focus on the social and environmental issues that our business can impact. As we look to Kimberly-Clark¡¯s 150th anniversary in 2022, how will we use principles of sustainability to further deliver essentials for a better life? This question has been at the heart of our work to develop our Sustainability 2022 platform and the next set of goals that it will entail. This work was built on an analysis of the global mega-trends that will impact our business, followed by a collaborative process involving our internal stakeholders, business and brand leaders and other participants. Using our 2013 materiality assessment and our analysis of global trends as a guide, we engaged this broader group in a number of business and regional workshops that took place throughout 2014. This process allowed us to prioritize issues based on their relevance to the business as well as the potential impact we could have, including: 
PEOPLE:  Investing in innovative social programs so people who lack the basic essentials in life ? sanitation, health, well-being ? get the help they need;
PLANET:  Reducing pressure on precious natural resources with the development of sustainable alternatives;
PRODUCTS:  And innovating to extend the life of product and packaging materials.
I look forward to sharing our specific goals with you soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
413,Legg Mason,3,USA,"As a global asset management company, we consider transparency a critical component of doing the right thing. We strive to be an industry leader in financial reporting and bring this same mindset to corporate social responsibility (CSR). While some firms remain cautious about making voluntary disclosures they consider ¡°non-financial,¡± Legg Mason considers them ¡°pre-financial,¡± and we believe that making them ultimately contributes to the bottom line. We openly share our key metrics and invite constituents to judge us, not just on our guiding principles, but our actions and our record, as well.
We recognize our commitment to CSR also  as a competitive requirement ? a key driver  of success in today¡¯s global marketplace. There are competitive advantages to offering ESG investment products and to achieving leadership in CSR reporting. In general, companies that meet high environmental, social and governance standards face less regulatory risk and may  be exposed to less reputational risk than those  with lower standards.
Additionally, CSR is increasingly relevant to our key constituents, and sharing our results builds credibility and inspires their confidence in us. Investors want to know that we ¡°walk the talk¡± of ESG investing by applying these principles toour own investments. Clients want to expand their investment options and mitigate volatility. Employees care about diversity of thought  and environmental stewardship, and take pride  in our performance. And communities seek reliable business partners that are committed  to making a difference.
We continually scrutinize our CSR program to find ways to improve our performance and in FY2016, we made notable progress in several important areas. To address growing global demand for  ESG products, Legg Mason Executive Committee members CFO Pete Nachtwey and Head of Business Development Tom Hoops convened  all ESG leads from across the company to  form an ESG Working Group to discuss how  to advance ESG awareness and support related  new product development.
We also added ESG expertise and capability through equity investments in two established investment firms ? Clarion Partners and Australia-based RARE Infrastructure. Both  Clarion and RARE ? along with Western Asset ? joined the list of Legg Mason affiliates that  are Principles for Responsible Investment  (PRI) signatories.In FY2016, our executive leadership team  formally recognized diversity and inclusion  as a critical strategic priority and we created a new Executive Diversity Council (EDC), sponsored by Tom Hoops, to continue the evolution of diversity and inclusion across  Legg Mason. Building upon the terrific work  of many deeply committed individuals across  the firm over the past 10 years, the EDC will develop and promote firm-wide policies to promote awareness and address identified diversity gaps.
Legg Mason and our affiliates also improve lives by making strategic investments in the communities where we live and work. In our home office city of Baltimore, we are especially pleased to have joined hands with other corporate leaders to support BLocal, an initiative to stimulate economic inclusion by building, buying and hiring local resources. This initiative is especially significant and impactful following the unrest of April 2015. Having outlined our commitment, we established a cross-functional working group to monitor our progress and explore opportunities to expand this engagement. As an extension of this commitment to Baltimore, Legg Mason became the first corporate partner to hire a Baltimore Corps Fellow to help guide  and expand our community outreach initiativesin underserved Baltimore neighborhoods. This Fellow will assist us in building partnerships with community stakeholders to build a better Baltimore for the long term.
As Legg Mason¡¯s formal CSR program enters its ninth year, I¡¯m gratified to see that our commitment to such principles as workplace diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship and community engagement  have become central tenets of our culture  and consistent with our mission. 
This commitment begins with the personal engagement of our top executives and builds through our many employees who embrace sustainability initiatives and community service. It is also reflected in the substantial investments that the Legg Mason Charitable Foundation makes in youth education.
Together with our affiliates, Legg Mason is committed to this important work. And we are excited by what we can do to improve lives ? and positively impact the world around us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
602,Legg Mason,4,USA,"At Legg Mason, Corporate Social Responsibility is more than our ESG investment capabilities ? it¡¯s about how we conduct our business. 
There¡¯s no doubt that more investors each day are coming to believe that focusing on ESG principles can help deliver what everyone wants: strong, risk-adjusted performance over the long term. Investors of all types, led by public pension funds, are embracing investment portfolios that consider each company¡¯s ESG performance and aim to deliver competitive returns, with relatively low risk and a positive social impact. Right behind the public pension funds is the Millennial generation, who tell us in survey after survey that they want their investments to reflect their personal values. 
This new generation of employees also cares deeply about environmental and social issues. They aspire to participate in a more diverse workforce, work for a company that invests  in professional development, and they embrace sustainability initiatives and community service. Legg Mason continues to identify opportunities to make local investments to lift people up ? and to better the communities in which  we live and work. There¡¯s an entire base of stakeholders,  particularly outside the US, but increasingly  in the US, who look to a company¡¯s good governance grades before they invest. As a public company CFO, I pay attention to that trend. More importantly, well-managed companies that exhibit strong governance are likely to be successful, long-term investments. 
This year, we took a fresh look at our overall CSR strategy to ensure that it aligns with our business strategy, as well as a diverse stakeholder base that includes clients, investment managers, Affiliates, shareholders, our Board, employees and regulators. We also introduced a number of new key performance indicators drawn from industry best practices  to give our stakeholders a clearer picture of  our values in action. 
Our Affiliate managers use a host of screening processes, investment strategies and dedicated ESG products to channel $80 billion, or 14% of our overall long-term assets under management (AUM) (as of March 31, 2015), toward investments that integrate ESG criteria. 
We also considered how our CSR strategy  could continue to evolve to improve our  business performance and extend our social impact. This is consistent with our mission, Investing to Improve Lives, which, as our Chairman and CEO Joe Sullivan stated in our 2015 Annual Report, ¡°ultimately ties together our people, our culture and our model, in pursuit of delivering exceptional results for  our shareholders.¡±
As asset managers, our Affiliates¡¯ opportunities exist to bring even greater  CSR focus to the investment side of our business. To that end, they are using proven ESG screening methodologies and analytics  to identify and, ultimately, fill gaps in our portfolio of ESG products.
We are also taking important steps to engage with our Affiliates to build a more unified reporting strategy that brings together such corporate functions as product development, real estate, procurement, marketing and distribution to collect CSR data across Legg Mason and our Affiliates. We will continue to align our social and community investments ? most prominently with youth education ? through the Legg Mason Charitable Foundation. Additionally, we support health and human services, arts and culture and environmental protection through volunteerism, sponsorship and employee board service. We also continue to champion diversity and inclusion across Legg Mason and educate employees throughout our network about the important position CSR occupies in Legg Mason¡¯s overall mission,  value system and business strategy.
I¡¯m proud of the terrific CSR platform Legg Mason has created ? and continues to improve. Legg Mason and our stakeholders consider this important work, and I¡¯m personally excited to engage with my colleagues across our Firm to advance  our efforts and deliver results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For those groups, value today is important, and value tomorrow is priceless. Tomorrow matters. And that¡¯s why we¡¯re focused on creating enduring value through sustainability. When it comes to sustainability, our goal is to foster innovation, integrity and security in ways that protect the environment, strengthen communities and propel responsible economic growth. These efforts drive innovation, reduce costs, boost efficiencies, all while maintaining our deep commitment to integrity. This, our second annual sustainability report, illustrates why 2012 was a milestone year for the way we manage environmental, social and governance performance. We established an Office of Corporate Sustainability to integrate business decisions affecting all of our stakeholders. We formed a council of executive leaders to govern and guide our sustainability policies and goals. And we launched our Go Green 2020 initiative, a new set of ambitious environmental goals aiming beyond regulatory requirements. When done right, sustainability guards our core values?do what¡¯s right, respect others and perform with excellence?and reinforces our culture of integrity.

As you read through our 2013 report, I hope you¡¯ll agree that the men and women of Lockheed Martin are propelling responsible growth, for today and tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
416,Lockheed Martin,3,USA,"Lockheed Martin¡¯s sustainability mission is to foster innovation, integrity and security to protect the environment, strengthen communities and propel responsible growth. Our commitment to sustainability influences our operations and informs our decision-making at every stage of our business lifecycle.
This 2014 Sustainability Report represents the fourth annual summary of our major accomplishments and opportunities tied to the larger environmental, social and governance issues that shaped our performance over the past year.
We made progress raising our operational performance levels that resulted in  a smaller environmental footprint, more effective supplier partnerships and enhanced ethical conduct controls. Our leading team of scientists, engineers and other experts continued to push the boundaries of innovation and discovery. We also renamed the Sustainability Technologies line of business within our Mission Systems and Training area to strengthen alignment of its portfolio.
In 2014, we remained disciplined with our sustainability efforts in six high-impact areas. We determined how current environmental, social and governance concerns would affect and shape our strategic plans. We implemented our Lockheed Martin Sustainability Management Plan, which allowed our leadership to focus on our comprehensive set of commitments. Here are some highlights from 2014:
1.  Governance: In our ongoing efforts to preserve our culture of integrity and combat corruption, we offered our first digital, interactive and mobile version of the Lockheed Martin Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Setting the Standard. This reference tool clearly outlines our corporate values and expectations?and makes them readily available to our employees, customers and suppliers.
2.  Information Security: We continued to strengthen our cyber security and information technology (IT) capabilities, expanding our efforts in the growing fields of homeland security, commercial aerospace and healthcare IT. Our Cyber Incident Response Assistance accreditation by the National Security Agency¡¯s Information Assurance Directorate makes us one of the few federally recognized companies certified to help organizations respond to their network cyber-attacks.
3.  Supplier Sustainability: We trained 14,000 of our suppliers on counterfeit parts, making them aware of the problem and helping alleviate quality and safety risks in the supply chain.
4.  Product Performance: We continued to invest in our energy portfolio and strategically partnered in several segments of the market, including energy generation, usage, storage and security. The commercial and public sectors sought our new energy and sustainability technologies like waste-to-energy and biomass plants, tidal power generation, and ocean thermal energy conversion. Also, we worked with a broad range of utility customers to seamlessly integrate their power, IT and communications networks as new sources of energy generation came  on line.
5.  Resource Efficiency: We voluntarily reduced our carbon emissions, energy use, water use and landfill waste from a 2010 baseline, actively shrinking our environmental footprint and decreasing our operating costs.
6.  Talent Competitiveness: We exceeded employee attrition targets, while  fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion that celebrates our different backgrounds, varied experiences and unique points of view. To help address the anticipated shortage of skilled workers for our industry in the coming years,  we teamed with several companies and non-profit organizations to promote  science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to young people?and inspired students to pursue STEM careers.
These efforts helped us earn distinction as a new addition to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and, for the fourth consecutive year, a position on the CDP S&P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership and Clean Performance Leadership Indices. This recognition helps confirm that our business strategy, which incorporates sustainability into our day-to-day operations, is not only responsible but also relevant to investors.
This report highlights some of the ways that we supported our customers, stockholders, employees, communities and the environment in 2014?and how we are shaping the future by engineering a better tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
603,Lockheed Martin,4,USA,"In today¡¯s complex and dynamic world, innovation is more critical than ever for achieving our shared aspirations for sustainable progress. At Lockheed Martin, the imperative to innovate has always been at the center of how we do business. And because of  our commitment to our core values ? to do what¡¯s right,  respect others, and perform with excellence ? we are driven  to innovate with purpose and integrity in everything we do. As we look around the world, it is clear that governments  and businesses face a host of 21st century challenges. Technology has accelerated the pace of change and made the global economy more connected than ever. With increased trade and interconnectedness, we have seen global security threats grow in their potential impact ? from the cost of debilitating cyber attacks to asymmetric warfare and economic contagions. We have also seen governments and industry identify other risks, such as climate change, which demand far-sighted action and collaborative efforts to ensure effective environmental stewardship. In light of these challenges and more, Lockheed Martin¡¯s team of scientists, engineers, and innovators is dedicated to setting clear goals to create visionary solutions to drive progress. This report demonstrates just some of the exciting work we are doing ? and how we are increasing the efficiency and reducing the environmental footprint of our business. In this report, you can see that we continued to find ways to integrate sustainability and effective risk-management practices to inform our strategic decisions at the highest levels in 2017. And we made great strides in assessing and managing aspects of our business performance. This enabled us to determine  how risks and opportunities in the corporate governance, social, and environmental realms could impact our bottom  line, and more importantly, our communities and stakeholders. Ultimately, we saw strong business performance and solid progress toward achieving our Sustainability Management Plan objectives for 2017. These results indicate the positive impact that proactively sustainable business practices have had on  our success. 
As we look at our strategy for growth in years to come,  we consider five core areas: Business Integrity: We cultivate a culture of ethical  conduct with employees, and we conduct business with  the utmost integrity. Product Impact: We focus on continually improving the efficiency of our design and production processes in order  to deliver safe, reliable, and affordable products and  services to our customers. Employee Wellbeing: We create an inclusive and engaging workplace environment that fosters a spirit of innovation  and encourages high performance. Resource Efficiency: We pioneer technologies and implement processes to mitigate risks and protect the environment. Information Security: We secure our infrastructure and operations against cyber security attacks and expand access  to these preventive technologies to our customer base. Throughout this report, you will learn more about how each of these core areas shape the execution of sustainable practices across our enterprise. You will also see case studies that illustrate how we support our customers, provide value to our stockholders, engage our employees, strengthen our communities, and protect the environment. As a leader in solving complex challenges, advancing scientific discoveries, and delivering innovative solutions to protect  global security, we recognize the potential for us to have a positive impact and influence on the future. For this reason, we are committed to being good corporate citizens and exemplifying sustainable and ethical business practices  that mirror Lockheed Martin¡¯s core values. The results documented in this report are a credit to the 100,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin who come to work to make a difference each day. They reflect the vision, values, and sense of mission that enable our strong performance and drive future growth. And they underscore the imperative for each individual and every corporation  to create the innovations and embrace the sustainable practices that will ensure a brighter tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
417,Lowe's,3,USA,"Of course, loving where you live extends outside of your home. Homes are part of the communities that surround us, so our interest and commitment cast a wide social responsibility net.  We aim to operate every aspect of our business with integrity, respect for people and care for the environment. This applies across our entire value chain, from the suppliers that manufacture our products, to our stores and operations and to the  quality and safety of the products we sell.
This is a long-term commitment that we approach through 
 continual improvement, and 2014 was a year of significant improvement for us. As I reflect on our accomplishments this year, a few highlights come to mind.
At the highest level of our company, we reaffirmed our commitment to social responsibility by revising the board of directors¡¯ governance committee charter to reflect the committee¡¯s oversight for these efforts.
We also gave back to the communities where we live and work. Lowe¡¯s and the Lowe¡¯s Charitable and Educational Foundation donated $28 million to community organizations, and we announced a 5-year, $23.5 million commitment to further our partnership with Habitat for Humanity.
Lowe¡¯s continues to be a great place to work. In 2014, for the  first time in the history of our annual employee survey, our  stores, distribution centers and customer support centers all reached our benchmark goal of 65 percent, indicating a highly engaged workforce. And we achieved a new record for our Lost Time Incident Rate, improving 21 percent since our 2012 baseline year, which reflects our efforts to make Lowe¡¯s a safe place for all employees.
To reduce our environmental footprint, we partnered with our transportation providers to introduce trucks powered by natural gas at five regional distribution centers, helping us reach our  goal of using natural gas vehicles to serve at least 20 percent of Lowe¡¯s stores served by an RDC.
Throughout this report, we describe these and the many other ways we¡¯re fulfilling our purpose through social responsibility. As we look to the future, we plan to continue enhancing and expanding our reporting, focusing on the social responsibility issues that are most important to our business.
We hope you enjoy our report. We encourage you to provide your feedback at socialresponsibility@lowes.com, and we look forward to reporting our progress a year from now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
604,Lowe's,4,USA,"What does it mean to be socially responsible? 
At Lowe¡¯s, it means we¡¯re accountable?to customers, to our people and to the communities we serve. It means we aim to do what¡¯s right?to find a solution that works for all of us. It means we strive to be trustworthy?to do what we say and keep our commitments. 
Last year, we issued our first report aligned with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, and I made a commitment to continue enhancing our reporting, focusing on the social responsibility issues that matter to our stakeholders. This report is a demonstration of that commitment and a summary of the actions we¡¯re taking as we build momentum on our ongoing journey to be a better corporate citizen.
As a purpose-driven company, Lowe¡¯s is committed to helping people love where they live. That¡¯s the lens we use to do what¡¯s right for customers and our communities. In 2015, more Lowe¡¯s employee volunteers than ever rolled up their sleeves to help people, schools and neighborhoods in need. In fact, last year every single Lowe¡¯s store in the United States, more than 1,700, participated in a Lowe¡¯s Heroes project. With double the budget to work with, they more than doubled the impact of their efforts. And we¡¯ve already announced plans to give our employees the opportunity to do even more in 2016.
Our commitment to helping people goes beyond community projects. It extends to safety and sustainability as well. We listen to customers to ensure we continually evolve to meet their needs. In 2015, we took several steps to make sure we¡¯re offering the best possible products. We worked with suppliers to remove ortho-phthalate 
plasticizers from all residential vinyl flooring products and committed to phase out the sale of products that contain neonic pesticides. We see it as our responsibility to take a leading role in helping bring better products to the market.
That kind of responsibility requires leadership, so developing our future leaders was an important area of focus in 2015. To continue to build a strong leadership team that reflects the diversity of our communities,  we launched a mentoring program that pairs female and minority store managers with market directors  to strengthen their leadership skills. And we remain focused on building diversity through our recruiting efforts, attending more than 100 recruiting events to attract people with diverse backgrounds and ideas.
We always strive to do our best, and in 2015 our best enabled us to make tremendous strides in meeting the needs of our employees, customers and communities. As you read this report, I hope you¡¯ll agree that Lowe¡¯s is focused on the social responsibility issues that are most meaningful to our business and to our stakeholders, and that we¡¯re focused on them for the right reasons. I¡¯m proud of what we accomplished in 2015, and I¡¯m looking forward to building on our momentum and sharing our results with you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

421,MetLife,2,USA,"MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO At MetLife, our corporate strategy is designed to create longterm value for our shareholders. To deliver on this strategy, MetLife must work successfully and sustainably with a range of stakeholders. It is our service to them that is the principal focus of our new corporate social responsibility report, which we are calling ¡°Global Impact.¡± In this report, we highlight the many ways that MetLife operates as a good corporate citizen. Importantly, we have developed the report in accordance with the latest G4 (fourth generation) guidelines published by the Global Reporting Initiative, the nonprofit organization that sets the standard for sustainability reporting. As a life insurance company, our very purpose is to enable policyholders to achieve financial sustainability in the face of life¡¯s most destabilizing events. MetLife has been doing this by making and keeping promises since 1868. As a global company that now operates in 46 countries, MetLife is committed to serving our customers in developed markets and to bringing financial protection to the growing number of middle-class customers in emerging markets around the world. For us, corporate responsibility begins with managing our business in a way that minimizes risk, preserves financial strength and allows us to make good on our financial commitments over the long term. But it does not end there. Our commitments to our various stakeholders were on display in a variety of ways in 2013. For customers, we enhanced our ability to offer superior service by making significant investments in technology and building a culture of customer centricity. For employees, we strengthened our diversity and inclusion efforts and conducted our first enterprisewide organizational health survey, the results of which were used to develop action plans for motivational leadership and stronger employee engagement. For the communities we serve, we refocused the MetLife Foundation on a new mission of bringing financial inclusion to people in need around the world?and backed it up with a $200 million, five-year funding commitment. For policymakers, we provided insight on the need for a regulatory framework that preserves solvency while ensuring consumer access to affordable financial protection. And for future generations, we continued to reduce the impact of our business on the environment by improving energy efficiency, increasing our use of low-carbon electricity sources and setting future goals that will further reduce our environmental footprint. MetLife is committed to continually improving our performance for all of our stakeholders by setting and achieving progressively more demanding goals over time. This is how we will fulfill our mission of ¡°helping people pursue more from life.¡± After you have finished reviewing this report, I think you will agree that we are succeeding.

605,MetLife,4,USA,"We made important progress in 2015 in building a stronger MetLife that delivers even greater value for all of its stakeholders. In our business operations, we launched the next phase of our corporate strategy, called Accelerating Value. 
Implementing this strategy requires us to look at every part of our business through three lenses: customers, competitors and cash. This helps us direct capital to businesses where we can deliver a truly differentiated customer value proposition and have a clear competitive advantage. It will also help us increase sustainable cash generation for our shareholders.
Based on these reviews and our assessment of the overall regulatory environment, we decided earlier this year to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business segment and sell our U.S. Retail advisor force to MassMutual. We believe these actions will bring significant benefits to MetLife as we move forward.  
Against this backdrop of business optimization and realignment, we also took important steps to fulfill our responsibility as a  good corporate citizen and produce positive global impacts: Protecting the Environment: We pledged to achieve the ambitious goal of carbon neutrality from our business operations by the end of 2016. We also pledged to meet several other new environmental goals by 2020. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recognized the importance of our commitment by presenting us with a Climate Leadership Award for excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management?Goal Setting. At the same time, we grew our total portfolio of green investments to $9.7 billion as we made new commitments to renewable energy projects and energy-efficient buildings. Building Strong Communities: We advanced our commitment to helping underserved people around the world connect to financial knowledge and services with an additional $30 million in Financial Inclusion grants provided by the MetLife Foundation. MetLife employees gave more than 72,000 hours of their time to support volunteer efforts around the world. They built homes with Habitat for Humanity, playgrounds with KaBOOM! and mentored young adults on work-readiness and financial literacy with LifeChanger.
Our investment in community and affordable housing projects reached $1.6 billion and our investment in infrastructure  projects totaled $7.8 billion. Creating a Great Place to Work: We developed a new Inclusion Index to measure how well we are integrating diversity and inclusion into our culture. To help our employees plan their careers and identify opportunities for advancement, we also established a new Global Grading Framework that standardizes jobs across markets. We were also proud to be named to the ¡°100 Best Corporate Citizens List¡± by Corporate Responsibility magazine for the first time. The ranking is based on a company¡¯s performance across seven areas: climate change, employee relations, environmental, financial, governance, human rights and philanthropy, and community support. 
MetLife is proud to continually set more ambitious goals not just for our financial performance, but for our environmental, social and governance performance as well. This is how we will build a more sustainable future for all of our stakeholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
423,Microchip Technology,3,USA,"I am pleased to announce Microchip¡¯s 2014 Sustainability Report. This report details our activities throughout the past three years at Microchip sites around the globe, from our environmentallypreferred products to our community involvement and workplaces initiatives. As a global company, it is important for us to not only focus our sustainability efforts at our home base in the United States, but at our facilities in the ASEAN and Europe regions where we operate.
In 2013, Microchip joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a voluntary initiative based on the idea that businesses have a role to play in advancing human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption principles through their own operations and through collaborative innovation. While Microchip has always placed great emphasis on complying with the laws and policies in the regions where we operate, we also value our position as a global leader and believe in the value of engaging in voluntary environmental and social initiatives. We believe, and are finding through empirical evidence, that effective integration of sustainability into our operations, our products, and our workforce help 
us become a stronger and more resilient company.
I am particularly proud of the environmental contributions that our low-power components make to a more sustainable world. Currently used in thousands of products across a range of industries, manufacturers choose Microchip products to help dramatically reduce their products energy consumption, extend their products useful life, and improve the user experience. This report highlights a few of the many examples of Microchip products that contribute to making the world a better place.  We are excited to share these innovations with you and look forward to how the application of our products will continue to shape the future. 
Ensuring a healthy and happy workplace is vital to Microchip¡¯s success as a company. I am pleased to share a few of the initiatives we have put in place for our employees¡¯ health and wellbeing. One of the more innovative new developments has been the introduction of our benefits mascot, Chip.  Chip is a fun character who appears around our facilities to raise employee awareness concerning the benefits available to them and their familiesWhether it is healthcare at our on-site clinics, company-sponsored guided meditation, or financial planning for our family¡¯s future, Microchip employees benefit most from the benefits they understand.  Chip has been doing a great job of raising that critical awareness. 
As in previous years, our workplace initiatives are recognized externally.  I am honored that once again our Thailand facilities have won multiple government-sponsored awards for welfare, safety, public health, and labor; and I congratulate our Gresham facility 
for winning the prestigious Patriotic Employer Award from the United States Department of Defense for Microchip¡¯s efforts to support our troops during deployment.
Community support and outreach are very important to Microchip, and we continue to provide support around the world in a variety of areas including education, environmental protection, and international aid and humanitarian relief. As a hightech company, we believe that Microchip has a special role to play in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through financial contributions, in-kind giving, and volunteerism. At a corporate level, we continue to provide support for robotics teams and competitions, and many of our employees are 
involved locally in supporting STEM, robotics, and other engineering education opportunities for students in their local communities.  I am extremely proud of the impact that Microchip has in STEM initiatives, and believe that our involvement will ensure that students enter the workforce ready to take on the next generation of engineering challenges.   
Microchip continues our commitment to the good works and ideals expressed by the United Way with the organization¡¯s efforts to end homelessness, end hunger, and promote the educational attainment that is critical for our children and youth to succeed.  To that effect, Microchip has again been recognized as a leader in our local community as our United Way Committee continues their fine efforts to support this remarkable organization.
Looking to the future, I believe that sustainability will continue to play an important role in Microchip¡¯s success, particularly as the demand for energy-efficient products continues to grow. I believe that we are well-positioned, with expert talent and capable facilities, to meet this evolving landscape. At the same time, Microchip must be prepared for the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Ultimately, I believe that thoughtful sustainability practices will help us weather these storms and continue our remarkable track record of success.  I look forward to sharing this journey  with you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
424,Mohawk Industries,1,USA,"Our success as a company is defined by the choices that we make every day. Many are routine, often mundane; others can have a profound and long-term impact on our performance. Some choices are fully informed ones, but others must be based solely on our best assumptions and instincts. Regardless of the circumstances, our stakeholders should know that Mohawk always strives to make the responsible choice. And that¡¯s not always easy. 
I¡¯m especially mindful of how hard it is, at times, to make good and responsible decisions given the recent business cycle. During a prolonged, multi-year industry downturn, we were faced with difficult decisions daily: Do we close this plant to benefit the business, but cost valued employees their jobs in the process? Do we invest scarce capital in product innovation, knowing it could be years before we see the return in sales growth? In these and other cases, the responsible decision was always the one that carefully considered and weighed the long-term impact and best interests of all our stakeholders ? the essence of what a truly sustainable business is all about.
Today, as the flooring industry is gaining momentum once more, we know we made many positive and responsible choices. Our focus on asset optimization, process improvement and product innovation ? all while carefully conserving capital ? has enabled us to emerge from the downturn in  a position of strength, to begin aggressively expanding our business again and to ultimately sustain profitable growth. This, in turn, enables us to pursue even more good choices, such as investments in training for our people or more efficient equipment that requires less energy, or R&D to discover the next renewable product input.
Business Expansion Resumes Thanks to improving industry conditions and solid execution by our organization, we were able to report profitable growth across all of our business units during 2012. We put our strong liquidity and balance sheet to work by acquiring three new businesses that expand our global footprint and build on our leading position in the tile and laminate categories. 
Mohawk has a long and successful record of integrating new businesses, and much of our attention in the coming year will be focused on this process. As always, we have completed  a significant amount of due diligence to ensure a thorough understanding of the strategic, operational and financial risks and opportunities associated with each of these businesses. All three have built leadership positions in their respective markets and share standards similar to our own for responsible business practices such as product quality, environmental stewardship and ethical conduct.
Product Innovation & Sustainability Product innovation also has been a continuing priority  during the past 12 months across all of our business units. We¡¯ve especially been pleased to leverage the technology of our proprietary SmartStrand¢ç fiber into a next-generation product, SmartStrand¢ç Silk¢â, which takes softness to a new level in the carpet category. It is worth noting that SmartStrand has been one of the most successful and sustainable innovations in our history, thanks to being made in part from renewable plant resources. Nothing furthers the cause for environmentally friendly products in the marketplace more than a successful product, and we¡¯re proud that SmartStrand can help tell that story. 
Looking ahead, our commitment to product innovation will remain as strong as ever and include a focus on products with sustainable attributes, which are important to many segments of our customer base. Such products can help to distinguish us from the competition and often help solve business challenges such as finding alternatives to petroleum and chemical inputs, as well as their accompanying price volatility, in carpet manufacturing. 
Great innovation, of course, requires substantial investments of both talent and dollars. This is why talent development and cost discipline will continue to be strategic priorities for us. The latter not only can help us direct funds toward important R&D work, but also aligns well with our efforts to work toward our 2020 sustainability goals around resource conservation. 
We are optimistic that the strengthening economic conditions in the U.S. will continue and are enthusiastic about the longterm potential of the flooring industry around the world. Though North America and Europe will account for the majority of our sales in the foreseeable future, we are excited to begin exploring opportunities in newer markets such as Russia, China, Brazil and India. An expanding global footprint brings with it an expanding scope of responsibilities. We recognize the increasingly diverse nature of our business and the complexities that accompany it. By continuing to make business decisions based on the best long-term interests of our stakeholders, we are confident that the good and responsible choice will always win with us. Thanks for your continued support of Mohawk Industries.Acquisitions have long been a major part of Mohawk¡¯s strategy for expansion into both new product categories and new geographic markets. At the end of 2012, we announced the acquisition of three new businesses ? Pergo, Marazzi and Spano. Each of these represents a new opportunity for us, while complementing our existing businesses. 
The purchase of Pergo, the most widely recognized name in laminate in both the U.S. and Europe, strengthens our leadership in that category. In the U.S., Pergo is distributed primarily in the home center channel, complementing our Quick-Step¢ç brand¡¯s strength in the specialty-flooring distribution network. Pergo¡¯s most significant market position in Europe is in the Nordic region, which allows us to broaden our laminate distribution from Western Europe into that area. Another significant advantage is Pergo¡¯s experience in laminate flooring technology, with unique patents on design and installation methods that enhance Unilin¡¯s leading patent portfolio. 
The addition of Marazzi has made us the global leader in ceramic tile, which continues to be the world¡¯s most popular flooring. Marazzi has a long history of product innovation and design sophistication, with products that include glazed ceramic and porcelain, technical tile, color-body porcelain and crystallized porcelain. Marazzi products are sold in more than 100 countries. 
 
Belgian panel board manufacturer Spano was our third recent acquisition. Spano manufactures and distributes chip and melamine board used to produce furniture and building products.

425,Mohawk Industries,2,USA,"A Message From Jeffrey Lorberbaum, CEO and Chairman Reaping the Benefits of Good Choices Mohawk had an extraordinary 2013, achieving some of the best financial results in Company history and demonstrating the power of exercising good judgment and making good choices. Following a prolonged and difficult industry downturn, we have emerged stronger than ever by relying on an experienced leadership team to communicate our vision, implement our strategy, optimize our operations and make the right choices to ensure long-term growth upon recovery. Those choices, coupled with the dedication of our talented global workforce, not only helped us to achieve outstanding 2013 results, but also have positioned us to continue to make good, sound and responsible choices as we grow our business around the world. The past year has also been a transformational one for Mohawk. As recently as 2006, our sales were largely confined to North America, with 60 percent of our sales generated by carpet. Today, approximately a third of our business is outside North America, and our net sales mix has changed to roughly 40 percent Carpet, 40 percent Ceramic and 20 percent Laminate & Wood. Moreover, much of this transformation has occurred largely during the past year as we integrated three acquisitions across seven countries. Mohawk is now the world¡¯s largest flooring company, with an exceptionally strong market position that can take us to an entirely new level of performance. As one would expect, however, this new growth, diversification and potential make Mohawk a significantly more complex organization today than in the past. While we have more opportunities to entertain, we also have new challenges to face. Likewise, a larger business and footprint means we have more choices to make day-in and day-out, thus magnifying the need to make sure our decisions are good ones. To help us do so, there are four ¡°choices¡± that transcend our businesses around the world and that are useful to ensure that we continue to grow our business in a responsible manner. Choosing to Reinvest in Our Business By the end of 2014, Mohawk expects it will have invested nearly $900 million in our existing businesses within a two-year period. These investments are ensuring that we have a state-ofthe-art manufacturing base to drive improvements in quality, productivity and sustainability. Our commitment to ongoing capital investment also increases our ability to manufacture in market and to maintain a high degree of flexibility among plants. This not only enhances our competitive position, but also helps us to better manage our environmental footprint through optimized transportation logistics and equipment. Choosing to Be Sustainable by Being Efficient Sustainable practices are inherently efficient practices. Mohawk has a long tradition, and indeed ¡°knack,¡± for driving efficiency throughout our manufacturing processes. This key competency was a primary enabler managing through the industry downturn and one we¡¯re committed to more than ever. Our new Zero Landfill program is a great example. This program helps local leadership analyze and evaluate their existing process waste streams, then develop an action plan to change the facility¡¯s operations and culture so that 100 percent of manufacturing waste can eventually be eliminated or upcycled. Currently we have 14 rug and carpet manufacturing sites that have received an internal landfill-free certification ? a number we hope to double within the next year. We view the program as a transformative one that¡¯s helping to alter the  ay ur workforce thinks about waste. In raising employee awareness, we also have an opportunity to influence how our people think about waste at home or in the community. Choosing Product Innovation to Achieve Progress No business ever wins by standing still. This is especially true in highly competitive markets such as flooring. R&D investments that lead to new, better and often more sustainable products have become a mainstay of our strategy in every category in which we compete. Our most recent breakthrough is Continuum¢â, a patent-pending proprietary process that creates higher-quality PET carpet by using only superior, FDA-approved PET bottle resin. The result is a stronger, more resilient carpet that contains up to 100 percent recycled content from PET bottles. Continuum not only improves our competitive power in the $1.5-billion-plus polyester carpet market, but also ensures that we continue to fully utilize our manufacturing infrastructure that can recycle approximately 5 billion bottles on an annualized basis. Similar to SmartStrand¢ç, our investment in innovation has once again produced a win for our business and a win for the environment. Choosing to Grow Globally and Manage Locally Though Mohawk¡¯s businesses and operations now span the globe, we remain very much a locally focused company. Whether we enter a market through acquisition, joint venture or greenfield construction, our choice is to manage the business at a local market level. To do so, we empower local leaders to make decisions based on local concerns ? be it our competitive position, our workforce or the communities in which we operate. At the same time, we leverage best practices across the enterprise to implement process improvements, increase efficiencies and reduce costs. As the largest participant in a fragmented global flooring market, we expect that our expansion into new markets will continue, but always with a healthy balance of both local and global perspectives. The Value of Good Choices As extraordinary and transformative as 2013 was for Mohawk, we believe the potential for even better years lies ahead. More than anything, our 2013 achievements demonstrate that good 
choices lead to great outcomes ? faster growth, greater innovation, more efficient operations and new shareholder value. Today, our diverse portfolio, leading brands, innovative products, operational excellence and strong management team are the foundation to build an even stronger business that can benefit all of our stakeholders. As always, thank you for your continued interest and support of Mohawk Industries. 
Sincerely, 
Jeffrey Lorberbaum
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
426,Mohawk Industries,3,USA,"Mohawk has had no shortage of opportunities to hone the process  of growing responsibly as we have built the world¡¯s largest flooring company. During the past three decades, our operational footprint has expanded from the U.S. to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Malaysia, Mexico and Russia. Likewise, our product portfolio has expanded from our flagship Mohawk carpet brand to encompass leading brands and market positions in ceramic, laminate and wood. 
These expansions have been accomplished through the acquisition and integration of more than 30 new businesses, as well as ongoing investments in legacy businesses. From 2013 through the first half of 2015, we¡¯ve committed nearly $3 billion to acquisitions and another $1 billion plus to investment in existing businesses. When we¡¯re making investments of that magnitude, we must get them right and we do so by adhering to a set of internal guidelines that continue to serve us well.
Reinvestment is key to making strong businesses even stronger. We view our investment in an acquisition as a start rather than a  finish. We understand that continual cycles of reinvestment are required to sustain a business long term. Capital investments in state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment, for example, can help  us conserve natural resources for our planet, create a safer working environment for our employees and enhance product quality for our customers ? all of which contribute to higher levels of profitability that drive more reinvestment. 
A global company is best run by local businesses. Though flooring is a common denominator across all of our businesses, there are very different dynamics within each unit, ranging from geographic markets to product categories to distribution channels. These differences are driven by factors such as regulatory requirements, employment practices and supply chains, to name a few, that also are unique to each business. As we grow around the world, our decentralized management approach places operational responsibility with the team closest to the ground in order to drive optimal transparency, accountability and performance. 
Best practices should be leveraged in a flexible manner. Sharing good ideas and best practices across Mohawk business units, geographies and brands can create significant returns while also complementing our decentralized management approach. Take our zero landfill waste program. What started as a pilot initiative in our rug and mat business was then leveraged throughout our entire Carpet business. Now, the program has been successfully implemented at 25 sites. Equally beneficial is the mindset that we¡¯re instilling among our manufacturing employees who are more mindful of their material use both at work and at home. In Mohawk¡¯s pursuit of growth and profitability, we never lose sight of who we are as a Company. Our challenge is to balance the growth of our business and global footprint with our sense of responsibility as an organization. It¡¯s the right thing to do; and  we have seen time and again that when growth is done well, it creates opportunities for our business and all of our stakeholders. 
More environmentally sound manufacturing practices lead us to higher levels of efficiency and profitability. Investment in R&D to innovate more sustainable products results in differentiated products that command a higher premium in the marketplace. Being a good and fair employer positions us to attract, retain and develop the best and the brightest talent. And, helping to build strong communities means we have good places to both live and do business. Simply put, growth done well makes good business sense.Inherent to the success of what will eventually be a global program is the flexibility for each site to adapt waste diversion processes to their particular plant. That flexibility helps to ensure that when one business unit passes a best practice to another, that practice is embraced and perhaps even enhanced in the process of adapting it to new needs. This holds true across every area of the business ? logistics, technology, safety, product development and sales, to name a few.
Another way to share best practices is through hands-on experiences. As our global organization grows, we are finding great value in providing rotational opportunities for employees among our business units. For example, our Malaysian hardwood manufacturing plant reports in to Unilin, which is based in Europe. Having an individual from the plant on a short-term assignment in Europe provides cross-development opportunities for both our employee and our business. 
The efficacy of our approach to growth was evident in 2014 as Mohawk recorded another strong year. Sales climbed 6 percent to $7.8 billion, while adjusted net earnings climbed 26 percent to $598 million. Beyond our financial performance, we grew well on numerous other fronts by:
?  Integrating three businesses acquired in 2013. ?  Acquiring a wood flooring plant in the Czech Republic to support expansion of our wood business in Europe and Russia. ?  Introducing new products in two of our most successful carpet lines, EverStrand¢ç, which contains up to 100 percent recycled content and utilizes our proprietary Continuum manufacturing process, and SmartStrand¢ç, made with a renewably sourced polymer. ?  Investing in our Ceramic business through a new production line  in Dallas, a new plant in Tennessee and the modernization of our European manufacturing facilities. ?  Recording double-digit percentage improvements across all of our corporate safety metrics, including Recordable Events and Lost and Restricted Workday incidents.
?  Achieving the highest ranking for a manufacturing company ? number 14 ? on Training magazine¡¯s annual Top 125 list, our tenth consecutive year of making this list. ?  Reducing our overall absolute energy use for the first time and energy intensity for the fifth consecutive year. 
Further, we began 2015 by announcing our intent to acquire the IVC Group, the fastest-growing supplier of luxury vinyl tile (LVT) in Europe. This acquisition, combined with the construction of a new LVT plant in the U.S., firmly establishes Mohawk as a leader in one of the fastest growing categories in flooring today. Also, in early 2015, we acquired a small Eastern European ceramic manufacturer, a great example of our practice of manufacturing products in the markets where we sell them in order to reduce our logistics and transportation impact.
Strong businesses are sustainable ones, and we are confident in Mohawk¡¯s long-term capabilities and potential. Through continuous business reinvestment, a highly defined business strategy and a well-developed sense of responsibility, we look forward to building on our track record of Growth Done Well for the benefit of all  our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your continued interest in and support of our Company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
427,Monsanto,1,USA,"Dear Sta keholders, We live in dynamic times. Rising affluence, increasing urbanization and the needs of our growing planet are putting pressures on our environment and our ability to support these demands sustainably. The topic of sustainability has taken center stage around the world and has driven the attention and focus of a growing number of powerful voices and interests around the world. We recognize that we have a place in these discussions and a commitment to be a leading corporate citizen. But a quiet, unwavering figure has remained for generations at the center of solutions to some of our world¡¯s most pressing needs; the farmer. And I¡¯m convinced supporting their ability to produce and conserve more?regardless of size and location?will help bring much needed solutions to some of our largest challenges for the future as well. As a company focused on agriculture and farmers, I am proud of the opportunity we have to offer farmers tools and services that promote a safe, healthy, affordable food supply for all of us. Sustainability is central to global agriculture and its success both today and in the future. The sustainability of agriculture is also central to our three-point vision?produce more, conserve more and improve lives. But it isn¡¯t just a vision. It¡¯s the heart of our business. Whether that is through our work in the field with farmers, or in the communities where we operate around the world, it is core to our global operations and is a priority for how we steward our business every day. Five years ago, Monsanto laid out an ambitious set of goals in sustainable agriculture focused on these key areas where our business could help to make a positive impact for farmers and broader society. We committed to support agriculture¡¯s ability to produce more on the same footprint of land while conserving other natural resources. At that time, we also committed to help improve lives by supporting new tools and approaches to help lift smallholder farmers out of poverty and improve their overall prosperity. Today, the more than 21,000 men and women of Monsanto around the world continue this important work. Agriculture is a tough business. And, it¡¯s clear that delivering innovation to the world¡¯s farmers to accelerate growth is more critical than ever. No single company, organization or government can do it all. The public and private sector need to do a better job of working together with increasing efficiency and scale. As part of this year¡¯s report, I¡¯m pleased to highlight our business¡¯ progress towards delivering against our commitments. Our progress on our sustainable yield goals are on track in some areas and not as far along in others. You will see this year we took some significant steps to further embed sustainability in our business and to increase public awareness of our environmental, societal and governance programs and performance. We completed our first formal materiality analysis of the issues that matter most to our business and society. This process built upon and enhanced our ongoing stakeholder engagement efforts and is helping define our business strategy. In addition, we established a Sustainability Strategy Council consisting of senior leaders from each of our global functions to guide and implement our sustainability efforts in our organization. It¡¯s a great start and we all realize there is more to do. I encourage you to take time to read this report and visit our website to learn more about the work that we are doing as a company and in partnership with others to support farmers and sustainable agriculture. I¡¯m very proud of the work that we¡¯ve done to date and I look forward to accelerating our efforts over the coming years. I welcome your feedback and critical-thinking about the issues central to the agriculture industry and meeting the demands of our growing planet. Together, I¡¯m convinced we can help farmers achieve more and help all of us and our world in the process.
Sincerely,
Hugh Grant
Chairman and CEO
Monsanto Company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
428,Monsanto,3,USA,"In actively pursuing a more sustainable approach to doing business and helping to feed the world¡¯s growing population, we recognize that sustainability is a journey, not a destination. But even though there is no real finish line in the sustainability journey (since people and organizations can always do better), there are measurable outcomes to mark our progress. That is why it¡¯s important for Monsanto to continuously take an inside-out approach to assessing where we are as a company, what¡¯s expected of us and how we can further embed sustainability into our business.
Today, no single issue will impact the world and the success of our farmer customers, our partners and our company more than sustainability, which includes our ability to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The sustainability journey is fully intertwined with the agriculture industry¡¯s ability to nourish a global population that¡¯s expected to grow from 7.1 billion people today to at least 9.6 billion by mid-century.
Monsanto participates in the Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI), the principles on which this report is based. This is critical because it connects us to the public at large, our stakeholders and other companies working through some of the same issues and provides a structure through which to share our commitments, our goals and our progress toward them. GRI also provides a vehicle for us to continually evaluate ourselves against our internal commitments and goals and work to improve our performance. We also remain committed to the  
10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and take affirmative actions to address these critical areas.
In this report, you¡¯ll see the wide-ranging approach we¡¯re taking to reducing our impact on the environment and  get a sense for the degree to which sustainability is part  of our business model and practices, our collaborations,  and the products we offer farmers. 
I¡¯m proud of what we¡¯ve accomplished so far, especially in the areas of water consumption and soil health, but I hope this report also helps you to see that we¡¯re not satisfied with our progress or impact and we¡¯re not standing still ? and  that everyone at Monsanto understands the importance  of accelerating our efforts, quickly. 
There¡¯s no set course on the sustainability journey and no corner on good ideas. We¡¯re still working through this ? with a lot of learning and candid conversations along the way. But Monsanto is committed to this journey because  we know that through transparency, collaboration and hard work, we can help make a balanced plate accessible to all while using fewer resources.
I hope you¡¯ll join with us and that you¡¯ll help hold us accountable. There¡¯s not a moment to lose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
606,Monsanto,4,USA,"Sustainability is a journey that presents a constant but welcome challenge: how can we push ourselves to achieve even more? How do we feed a growing planet in a changing climate?
These are tough questions, and we must collaborate to find answers. We grow better together. 
At Monsanto, we have deep expertise in a range of topics. But we¡¯re certainly not experts on everything. That¡¯s why we work with farmers, researchers, nonprofit organizations, universities, NGOs and other businesses to share expertise and ideas. In this year¡¯s report, we¡¯re pleased to feature perspectives from some of our collaborators on critical issues facing agriculture. 
In December 2015, we announced our intention to make our operational footprint carbon neutral by 2021. And, more importantly, we rolled out a vision to help farmers build upon the great work that they¡¯ve already achieved and someday drive carbon neutral crop production on farms all over the world. I think 2015 was a tipping point in global efforts to address climate change. The Paris Agreement and related efforts drove home the point that we all need to work together to address this issue. Monsanto is proud to be a small part of that. 
Monsanto is also a co-chair of the Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) working group of the Low Carbon Technology Partnerships initiative led by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The CSA aims to make more food available, strengthen the climate resilience of farming communities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from commercial agriculture. 
We¡¯re using data science to leverage information about seeds, soil and weather to help farmers use resources more efficiently and raise better harvests, improve their livelihoods and their efforts to steward their land. We¡¯re providing information and answering questions about the safety of our products, particularly when those skeptical of modern agriculture raise questions. 
Monsanto recently advanced important sustainability goals. We¡¯ve increased irrigation efficiency in our seed production business and curbed our operational greenhouse gas emissions intensity in our crop protection business. And we became the first company to partner with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation¡¯s Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund, making a multimillion-dollar commitment to support efforts to benefit monarch butterflies.
2015 also presented some challenges. Depressed commodity prices have been hitting companies in many different sectors, including agriculture. This economic reality 
meant the necessary separation of some of our employees and the suspension of some planned work. As a company in the business of helping farmers, when their business hurts, ours does too. But I¡¯m confident that we have a sound plan for moving forward.
Monsanto will continue working hard to  become a more sustainable company.  We committed to reporting in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative and supporting the recently released United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We remain committed to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, filing our Communication Progress and taking affirmative actions to address these critical areas.
All things considered, this was a pivotal year in our sustainability journey. We¡¯ve taken decisive action on climate change, and we¡¯re making real progress against our commitments. I¡¯d like to thank the thousands of employees, farmers and partners who made that possible.

429,Moody's Corp,2,USA,"Q: Companies are increasingly talking about their roles in having a social impact in addition to their traditional economic impact. What do you believe  is Moody¡¯s social purpose? A: Moody¡¯s primary social purpose is to help facilitate the flow  of capital from people who have money to invest to those who are seeking it. We do this by providing independent opinions on the level of risk involved, thus increasing the confidence of investors and the likelihood that capital will flow where it is needed. In that way, Moody¡¯s is helping to improve the lives of people no matter where they live. For example, Moody¡¯s rates bonds that, when they find investors, help schools improve their facilities, help build water treatment plants in third-world countries, and help large companies build products that  improve our quality of life.Q: How does Moody¡¯s use its products, services and philanthropic endeavors to create positive change? A: Moody¡¯s products help create positive change in a number of ways. Moody¡¯s Investors Service provides information about credit to both lenders and borrowers, which in turn often results in infrastructure and other social and economic improvements. On the Moody¡¯s Analytics side, we offer tools and training to help people and companies become better lenders and more intelligent borrowers. Our research, training and software  tools improve the world¡¯s understanding of risk, which allows investors to be more confident and lend more frequently, ultimately resulting in more social good.
Our philanthropic endeavors are carried out by The Moody¡¯s Foundation, which focuses primarily on mathematics,  economics and finance education. We have inspired hundreds of thousands of students in the United States and the United Kingdom and plan to expand our funding to other countries.  The Moody¡¯s Foundation also funds global initiatives in  economic development and health and human services, civic, as well as arts and cultural programs in our local communities. We continue to deepen our commitment to build social change as  we invest more funds in The Moody¡¯s Foundation and hence in our communities.
Q: Why is corporate social responsibility important to Moody¡¯s? A: As a company whose products and services have an impact on global, regional and local markets, we feel a strong sense of belonging to and a responsibility to serve the communities that are central to our company. Our philanthropy and other social responsibility actions follow from there. 
Moody¡¯s is a company that is dependent on its People. We do  not create a physical product, but rather opinions, data, software and services are our products. It is important to keep them satisfied and engaged. One way to do this is through the work itself, which our employees enjoy because they believe it benefits others and improves lives. Another is by providing them opportunities to give back. We see a lot of engagement from senior managers who sit on the boards of nonprofits and from our associates worldwide who actively embrace volunteerism. Volunteerism is definitely part of Moody¡¯s DNA. 
We try to do what we can to mitigate negative effects on the Planet. We are a fairly green company in that we do not produce products that pollute or negatively impact the environment and we actively work to recycle, reduce our  carbon footprint and rent space in LEED-certified buildings  like our headquarters, 7 World Trade Center. We also create policies to encourage employees to lower their carbon  footprints by cycling to work or using public transportation. 
From a Profit perspective, we are inherently creating social  good and improving the lives of others by facilitating the  flow of dollars through the global economy. The creation  of social performance assessments and other products  will ensure that this happens globally at all levels, from  small-scale entrepreneurs to start-up companies to  multinational corporations.

430,Moody's Corp,3,USA,"As a leading authority on credit and risk, Moody¡¯s has a responsibility to our customers, employees, investors and the public to uphold the highest standards in our work.
We live by our core values of integrity, insight, intellectual leadership, inclusion and independence. Together, they guide the way we work internally and the way we interact with our customers and other stakeholders.
Through Moody¡¯s broader outreach efforts,  the company is increasing its visibility in  the area of sustainable and responsible investing. In 2014, Moody¡¯s Investors  Service President and COO Michel Madelain was invited to speak at the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Global Dialogue at the United Nations Committee on Trade and Development 2014 World Investment Forum in Geneva. Together with 30 CEO-level executives representing stock exchanges, companies, institutional investors and  high-level policymakers, Michel participated in a discussion of the sustainability-related opportunities and challenges facing the  capital markets today. Michel¡¯s participation  in this forum signals our deep interest in the topic of sustainability and our commitment to incorporating corporate governance and environmental or social factors in our credit analysis when they are relevant and material.
Internally, we measure our impact by looking at the three Ps of the triple bottom line: People, Planet and Profit. We take our responsibility seriously in all three areas, and our efforts reflect our core values.
Moody¡¯s has always recognized that people are our most important asset. We hire the best individuals and give them the tools they need to succeed, including ongoing training and professional development opportunities. Our work environment is collegial and 
challenging ? we encourage our employees to express their opinions and be open to their colleagues¡¯ feedback. 
Outside our offices, we support our communities through financial and in-kind donations and volunteerism, spearheaded by The Moody¡¯s Foundation. In 2014, the Foundation donated $6.18 million to  charitable causes and facilitated 14,794  hours of volunteer service.
Although Moody¡¯s is not a large consumer of natural resources, we make a strong effort to consume less by reducing, reusing and recycling. We track our performance closely and report our success annually in this report. In 2014, we saved 2.2 million Kwh of electricity through our conservation programs and recycled 257 tons of paper.
Profit to us means not just producing returns for our shareholders, but also ensuring that our credit and risk products are objective, transparent, accurate and insightful. Our customers know that they can trust Moody¡¯s to deliver the research and tools they need to manage risk and make informed decisions. And research has shown that, over time, Moody¡¯s credit ratings are high quality and predictive  of default. 
This report details how we put our commitment to the triple bottom line into action. We believe that by doing so, we  help achieve our mission of being the  world¡¯s most respected authority serving  risk-sensitive markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, the world¡¯s population exceeds 7 billion, and by 2050 it is expected to surpass 9 billion. Cities are becoming denser, clean water is increasingly scarce, and many communities struggle with inadequate nutrition, lack of housing and periodic disease outbreak. Morgan Stanley is doing its part to contribute to a prosperous, sustainable world for a larger population. We are managing our own risk and driving funding toward projects and companies that provide widespread, sustainable benefits for society and the environment.
We built upon this commitment to sustainability over the past year in a variety of ways. In 2013, we launched the Institute for Sustainable Investing, and, in 2014, we focused on developing new products and services that mobilize capital and resources to help address environmental and social challenges. The Institute¡¯s mandate is to build scalable financial solutions that deliver competitive financial returns, while promoting positive environmental and social impact.
Reflecting the increasing demand for sustainable and responsible investments, we saw growth in our Investing with Impact Platform, which offers more than 120 vehicles that enable clients to align their values with their investments. Products focus on a variety of objectives, including clean energy, water resources and affordable housing.

We believe that incorporating sustainability into how we do business supports a sound global financial system and global economy, creating long-term value for our business, our clients and society.
Momentum for sustainable investing continues to build, and Morgan Stanley¡¯s Institute for Sustainable Investing has been instrumental in this effort. In 2016, assets under management on our Investing with Impact Platform surpassed $5 billion, bringing us more than halfway to our goal of $10 billion by 2018. In June, we issued our own $500 million green bond to fund the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. We also made significant progress in our operational sustainability and are more than halfway to our 2017 carbon-reduction goal.
We are proud of our culture of putting clients first, leading with exceptional ideas, doing the right thing and giving back to the communities in which we live and work around the globe. It is with these values in mind that we strive to engage all of our 55,000 talented employees in building a truly sustainable business.

From controlling costs to delivering greater shareholder value to volunteering in the communities we serve ? corporate social 
 responsibility is embedded in our founding principles and put into practice daily. In three short years, our CSR practice has brought about substantial progress:  ¡á	We continue our membership on three leading indices ? FTSE4Good, MSCI World ESG   Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index ? and remain highly ranked by ESG   research providers. ¡á Northern Trust charitable contributions increased to $15 million in 2012 and, for the first time, our partners received two paid days off to volunteer in the community.
These accomplishments would not be possible without the engagement of our worldwide staff. Every level of management is committed to excellence in recruiting, retaining and engaging the best and brightest to deliver enhanced long-term value to our shareholders. Innovation is key to our continued development as leaders in CSR. Our CSR Task Group, a global cross-functional team, is leading the way to improve the way we do business. For example: ¡á	We have heightened our focus on responsible investing through an agreement with MSCI Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) Indices and Research.  The agreement broadens our ability to assist clients in meeting their ESG investment objectives  as more and more become aware of how these objectives potentially influence a corporation¡¯s brand reputation. ¡á	We introduced our Print Smart campaign to increase employee engagement in environmental sustainability and provide partners with a way to reduce paper waste generated by outdated or inefficient business processes.

438,Northrop Grumman,3,USA,"2014 CEO MESSAGE Through affordable technologies and innovations, Northrop Grumman provides its customers with products and services that help them meet their critical mission requirements. We are similarly devoted to corporate responsibility and sustainability, and this report describes our efforts in 2014.
Sustainability is fundamental to everything we do at Northrop Grumman. Our business approach incorporates sustainability to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. This report describes our:
? Foundational commitment to ethics, integrity, and compliance ? Transparent corporate governance and leadership ? Commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce operating in a safe manner ? Dedication to quality and customer satisfaction ? Effective partnerships with suppliers and other business partners ? Conduct of operations in an environmentally sustainable manner ? Corporate citizenship programs to advance education, support military service members and their families, and partner with the community leaders and groups where our employees live and work.
A key step in developing this 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report was ensuring the content reflects issues that are important to Northrop Grumman. In our assessment, important issues for reporting are those that, in the view of our Board, management, employees, and external stakeholders, have the potential to significantly affect sustainable performance. Here are some examples from our efforts in 2014: 
Build Leaders at Every Level In 2014, we achieved greater diversity at all levels of our organization, including within the ranks of our company officers and with executive-level appointments. We enhanced talent management processes and tools to identify and accelerate the advancement of highpotential candidates including women and people of color. We encouraged leaders at every level through participation in leadership forums and employee resource groups. Our Global Diversity and Inclusion organization has helped us to implement a cohesive plan to create a positive work environment for all employees.
Protect the Environment Through 2014, we achieved a reduction of our greenhouse gas intensity (metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per million dollars in sales) by 26.2 percent from 2008 levels. Last year we also announced our 2020 greenhouse gas reduction goal to reduce our absolute emissions 30 percent from 2010 levels. This goal reflects our renewed commitment to reduce our environmental impacts, mitigate climate change-related risks and support the commitments of our customers and industry partners.
 
Improve Education During 2014, we invested more than $15.9 million from Northrop Grumman contributions and the Northrop Grumman Foundation to fund global science, technology, engineering and math education programs and initiatives that make a difference for students and their teachers.
Our commitment at Northrop Grumman is to embody our company values through our daily actions.

609,Northrop Grumman,4,USA,"2015 CEO MESSAGE Our purpose at Northrop Grumman is to provide our customers with products and services that help them meet their critical mission requirements. To do so, we operate with a daily commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. We describe those efforts in this 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report including:
? Leadership ? Our Business ? Governance
? Innovation ? Environmental ? People and Culture Sustainable performance begins with our devotion to creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. This approach requires an organizational focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workforce dedicated to ethics, integrity and compliance. From there we build effective partnerships with suppliers and utilize transparent corporate governance and leadership practices. We champion corporate citizenship programs to advance education, support military service members and their families and collaborate with members of our communities.
 
The 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report reflects activities that have the potential to significantly affect sustainable performance. Here are some examples from our efforts in 2015: 
?  As part of our commitment to providing an inclusive work environment, approximately 19,000 Northrop Grumman employees participated in our Employee Resource Groups, which provide opportunities for networking, community outreach, professional development, recruiting and support to the business. We also received a 100 percent score on the 2016 Corporate Equality Index, a national survey on corporate policies and practices related to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) workplace equality. Additionally, Northrop Grumman appears on DiversityInc's ""Top 50 Companies for Diversity"" list. 
?  We continued to focus on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs to improve education. Our efforts included investing more than $17.4 million from Northrop Grumman contributions, and the Northrop Grumman Foundation, to fund projects globally that make a difference for students and their teachers. In total, in support of the global communities where we live and work, Northrop Grumman and our employees donated more than $31.7 million, including support of military and veterans groups and health and human services initiatives. Our employees complemented that effort by providing more than 30,558 unpaid, volunteer hours. ?  For the fourth consecutive year CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) recognized Northrop Grumman for our climate change governance, strategy and emissions inventory. In 2015, we received a perfect 100 score and also announced our 2020 goals to reduce water use by 20 percent from 2014 levels, and achieve a 70 percent solid waste diversion rate (waste diverted from landfill). For their focus and diligent efforts throughout 2015, I want to thank all of our employees.

442,PepsiCo,3,USA,"On the surface, profit is a word that is easily defined: to make money. In reality, however, that definition is incomplete. In a world that is being radically reshaped by sweeping forces of change??? from technological innovation and globalization to resource scarcity, climate change and public health challenges??? how companies make money is just as important as how much money they make.
Without question, profits are the engine that propels a corporation forward. But the blind pursuit of profit at all costs is untenable. It is essential that we make money the right way. After all, if communities suffer as a result of a company¡¯s actions, those returns are not?sustainable.
Today, a company¡¯s profits are inextricably tied to the prosperity of its consumers, customers, employees, communities and society writ large. More than ever before, profitability and sustainability are synonymous.
Corporations should embrace this new way of doing business. Profitable companies of the 21st century will be those that align the needs of their business with the needs of the world around them.
With this in mind, PepsiCo looked out across the food and beverage landscape nearly a decade ago and charted a new course. We recognized a simple truth: there is profit in purpose. Sustainability is not something to support with the profits we make, but rather a?path to delivering profitability. Weaving sustainability into the very fabric of our organization is a way to help  future-proof our business for the changing world around us.
At PepsiCo, we focus on three pillars of 
 sustainability: Human, Environmental and Talent. We are working to improve the nutritional profile of our products and offer a wider selection of nutritious foods and beverages in response to growing consumer demand. We are striving to reduce our impact on the environment and conserve natural resources, reducing our operating costs in the process. And we are continuously investing to build a diverse and engaging culture inside PepsiCo that allows us to attract the next generation of talent we need to propel our company forward.
These three pillars form the foundation of what?we call Performance with Purpose, and they help to drive our financial results. The report that follows describes the significant progress we made in each of these areas in 2014. We are particularly proud to report that PepsiCo achieved four of our environmental goals ahead of schedule.
It is clear that in the years and decades ahead, the private sector will be increasingly impacted by global environmental and social challenges that no single company, industry, government or nongovernmental organization (NGO) can address alone. Collaborative solutions, in which we all play our role, hold the key to meaningful and lasting progress.
The strongest cross- sector partnerships flourish when each member engages in constructive dialogue. This dialogue is, at times, lacking today. For example, the relationship between corporations and some NGOs can be purely adversarial. While NGOs should absolutely push hard for companies to change, they should also acknowledge when companies set thoughtful goals and take serious steps to achieve them. We share many common objectives and must find more opportunities to join hands rather than simply pointing fingers.
For our part, PepsiCo is fully committed to engaging partners who seek progress on our shared challenges. We are proud of the relationships we have built with many highly respected organizations around the world. Moving forward, we intend to expand and strengthen these partnerships. The NGO community brings in-depth experience and local knowledge that is critical to solving big?problems, and we will continue seeking new opportunities to work together on topics most significant to our business and on?which?we can make a meaningful impact.
Simply put, we need cooperation at all levels. As such, the private sector must step forward and offer its unique capabilities to develop new solutions, uncover new opportunities and, ultimately, build the viable, trusted companies of tomorrow.
That is why PepsiCo is more committed to Performance with Purpose than ever before. It is how we will position our business for 
 sustainable long-term growth and contribute to solving broader challenges that impact each and every one of us.
In this report, you will see how we are 
 achieving progress through sustainable 
 agricultural practices, innovative methods of water conservation, more nutritious product offerings and more diverse workplaces. These efforts don¡¯t come at the expense of profit. Rather, they are examples of just some of the work underway that we are confident will help fuel our profits for generations to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
610,PepsiCo,4,USA,"We have called our approach Performance with Purpose, and it has guided all of our efforts, galvanizing us to embrace a deeper sense of meaning in our work at PepsiCo.
As we reach the 10-year mark in our journey, I want to  reaffirm my view that this approach is the only way to run a successful global corporation in the 21st Century.
Understanding why Performance with Purpose has propelled PepsiCo forward starts with acknowledging a simple truth: we live in challenging times. That was the case when we began this journey in 2006, and it is the case today.
We are seeing levels of political and economic volatility that we have not confronted for many years. Technological change is disrupting entire industries. Governments are facing budget shortfalls. And trust in institutions is near all-time lows, as consumers increasingly expect companies to?make money in a way that does not burden society.
These challenges are compounded for global businesses like PepsiCo that also need to act locally ?  satisfying local preferences, complying with local rules, and meeting local?needs ?  in every country where we work.
To succeed in this kind of environment, corporations ?  and the executives who lead them ?  need to do three things exceedingly well.
First, we need to focus on delivering strong financial performance. Second, we need to deliver it in a way that is sustainable over time. And, finally, we need to deliver it in a way that is responsible and responsive to the needs of the communities all of us share. That is how we will work to create the conditions for people to prosper, helping ensure they continue to welcome PepsiCo and our products into their neighborhoods and homes.
For the past 10 years, Performance with Purpose has been helping us deliver returns in this way ?  and we are incredibly proud of the progress we are making.
We are reducing added sugars, saturated fat and salt in many of our products, while continuing to expand our lineup of nutritious foods and beverages to meet growing consumer demand. We are significantly improving our operational water use and energy efficiency, reducing our packaging and waste, and promoting responsible agricultural  practices globally. We are building a workplace that attracts the 
INDRAworld¡¯s?best and brightest. And we are doing all of this while nearly doubling our net revenue and outperforming the S&P 500, with a total shareholder return of 142?percent since 2006. Simply put, we are not just changing the way we spend money ?  we are changing the way we make it.
As proud as we are of these results, however, we also know that our work is far from complete. There are major  challenges to overcome around the globe. From obesity and undernutrition to resource scarcity and climate change to underemployment and injustice and inequality of all kinds, we must stop and ask ourselves what is required of leaders over the next decade ?  to serve our shareholders, our employees and the world all of us inhabit.
In response, we are redoubling our commitment to Performance with Purpose and renewing our goals, to help create a healthier relationship between people and food over the coming decade. Our focus will include transforming our portfolio and offering healthier options while making our food system more sustainable and communities more prosperous. In doing so, we believe we will pave the way for PepsiCo¡¯s future growth and help others thrive.
Our 2025 agenda has been informed by many of the world¡¯s leading experts and institutions. We have closely mapped our plans to the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, as we work to make valuable contributions to our shared global agenda. We have worked to respond to the expectations of our investors and stakeholders. And we are focusing our efforts where we believe PepsiCo can achieve the greatest impact by leveraging our people, our capabilities and our global partnerships.
We recognize that we are stewards of a great Company  with the opportunity not only to make a profit,  but to do so in a way that makes a difference in the world.
To date, we have centered our Performance with Purpose work on human sustainability (now Products), environmental sustainability (now Planet) and talent sustainability (now People). Going forward, we look to achieve greater progress in?these areas, as previewed on next page and described in more detail later in this report.
I believe that Performance with Purpose will lift our Company to even greater heights in the coming years. But we cannot achieve those heights alone. Delivering solutions to shared challenges will require working together with governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders. Inside corporations, there are valuable capabilities and resources that can be harnessed to advance sustainable development. Inside governments, there are dedicated public servants who work to improve people¡¯s lives. And inside NGOs, there are passionate leaders who are committed to their cause and whose tireless advocacy is essential to bringing about change.
We live in an interconnected, interdependent world, and we cannot afford to operate in silos. We need to use our collective strengths in ways that benefit everyone. As PepsiCo renews our Performance with Purpose journey and begins work on our 2025 goals, that is exactly what we are doing, recognizing that we are stewards of a great Company with the opportunity not only to make a profit, but to do so in a way that makes a difference in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
444,Praxair,1,USA,"In 2012, Praxair delivered solid financial results while navigating through a challenging global economic environment. Our sustainable development program was a key component of our success that will become more important as we look to the future. This year¡¯s report clearly demonstrates we are on the right path. 
 
Our business model frequently brings environmental and energy efficiencies to our own processes and those of our customers. This is increasingly important in a world in which energy demand is rising, along with our growing need to reduce dependence on finite natural resources. We recognized this and sought to do something about it. In an evaluation of the carbon productivity of just three of our applications, we found that we enabled greenhouse gas benefits that were double those of our operational greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
Praxair is helping our planet meet one of its crucial challenges: to make more with less.  
 
Sustainable development is also providing direct business value. Our productivity organization achieved savings of $448 million in 2012. ¡°Sustainable productivity¡± ? cost savings that also bring environmental advantage ? contributed 25% of these total productivity dollars. This includes more than 1,750 projects that saved more than 300 million gallons of water, 800 million KWh of electricity and approximately 500,000 MT CO2e. Projects like these are sourcing new ideas for replication, providing Praxair with new ways to maintain our productivity advantage.  
 
Sustainability values have tapped into employee values and we are seeing enormous enthusiasm for these programs. The most significant example of employee engagement has been our Zero Waste initiative. From 11 participating sites, including 10 that achieved zero waste in 2011, we grew to 187 participating sites in 2012, with 89 achieving zero waste. More than 6,000 employees are pursuing zero waste at their sites, while at the same time they are reducing our environmental footprint, decreasing risk and saving money. The Praxair Foundation is ¡°matching¡± these employee efforts by funding the planting of 250,000 trees in 2013. We want to show that sustainability does not only save money, it adds social, environmental and economic value as well. 
 
In order to stay competitive, Praxair is collaborating with stakeholders inside and outside the company. We work with universities in all of our geographies to promote sustainable innovation. We hosted our first supplier innovation forum in Brazil and have launched a new award to recognize our business partners for their contributions to sustainable innovation. In the environmental area, we worked with a local environmental agency in New England to restore biodiversity. In the area of diversity, we extended our partnership for STEM education with the American Association of University Women (AAUW).  
 
Praxair is increasingly investing in our value chain and gaining long-term benefits as a result. 
 
For the 10th consecutive year, Praxair was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We also marked our fourth consecutive year being named as a top green company by Newsweek, ranking number one in the Standard and Poor¡¯s 500 Materials sector and number four in the Worldwide Materials sector. Additionally, our global safety team maintained best-in-class performance in recordable injuries, lost workdays and high severity vehicle accidents ? a tribute to the hard work and diligence of our employees around the world. In 2012, our employees across the globe contributed more than 85,000 volunteer hours ? donating their time to initiatives that promote higher education, support health research and provide resources to disadvantaged families. The efforts of our employees have benefited more than 300,000 people worldwide: providing a net benefit ratio of 10 beneficiaries to every 1 employee.  
 
I am proud to be a part of Praxair¡¯s global team, in conjunction with our diverse stakeholders, as we drive sustainability efforts throughout the company. Making our planet more productive does not only mean we make more with less? it means we create lasting social, environmental and economic value.

611,Praxair,4,USA,"Sustainable Development is ingrained in Praxair¡¯s culture, and an integral part of our mission of making our planet more productive.  This year¡¯s Sustainable Value Report again illustrates some of the important achievements that are refl ected in our fi nancial and operational results and the global impact of our business. 2015 results include: ?

Financial: Financial strength, capital flexibility, our mix of high-quality businesses and strong execution allowed the company to exceed our longterm target range of 13 ? 14 percent return on equity. 
Customer: We created the positions of Chief Customer Officer and Chief Privacy Officer to deliver consistent, valuable customer experiences and relationships for all Prudential clients.
Talent and Culture: Our talent and culture will be the most important factors in our long-term success. Diversity and inclusion are emphasized in every part of the company. We continued our work to help U.S. military Veterans transition to success in the corporate world, opening a center in El Paso, TX to provide meaningful training and employment to Veterans and their family members.
Social: We implemented a new global Strategy for Corporate Social Responsibility, leveraging company resources to develop solutions that will help the underserved achieve economic security.
The investments we are making in our people, businesses and communities will enable us to deliver value over the long term to our customers, investors and stakeholders. We look forward to ongoing productive dialogue and your feedback.

612,Prudential Financial,4,USA,"More than 140 years ago, Prudential was founded on the belief that financial security should be within reach for everyone. Today, we combine our history, experience and commitment to innovation to advance the progress and ambitions of people ?  organizations and communities. At our core we remain committed to our founding purpose ?  serving the complex needs of society while creating value for our stakeholders. 
We¡¯ve titled this report ¡°The Purpose of Sustainability¡± to demonstrate the inextricable linkage between pursuing our purpose and crafting enduring vitality. Underlying our purpose is the fact that every day, we pledge to honor obligations that may come due many years from now, like paying a life insurance claim or providing reliable retirement income. Sustaining Prudential¡¯s ability to create value over the long term is foundational to keeping these promises. 
In 2016, our diversified and balanced mix of businesses produced competitive advantages and opportunities to generate returns that trended above our peer group. We reported solid financial results, met many of our nonfinancial objectives and showed good progress in our four building blocks of sustainability:
 Financial: Financially, 2016 was a solid year with good momentum across our businesses. Our balanced approach to capital deployment allowed us to provide good returns to shareholders while making investments in our long-term growth.
 Customers: With customers living longer, younger and faster, innovation is crucial to meeting their needs. In late 2016, Prudential was named to the CNBC IQ 100 index because of the company¡¯s investment in and the development and deployment of our intellectual property to promote strategic advantage.
 
Talent and Culture: Talent is our most crucial form of sustainable competitive differentiation. In 2016, we continued to focus on recruiting, retaining and engaging a multigenerational and diverse workforce. We invested heavily in current talent development and in cultivating a strong talent pipeline.
 Social: We made important progress in financial inclusion when we convened our first cross-company summit on underserved markets. We were pleased to be recognized by the USO for our long-standing commitments to military veterans and their families.
There are many ways to evaluate a company¡¯s success. At Prudential, more than 49,000 Prudential employees rally around belief in our purpose, knowing that the social value we create as a company, combined with the value we create for all our stakeholders helps build a shared and lasting prosperity. 
We rely on our stakeholders to help guide our sustainability journey and would welcome your feedback.

450,Royal Caribbean Cruises,2,USA,"Moving to this method of reporting is one way that we are advancing our sustainability commitment. Since we formalized our commitment to the oceans by creating our Save The Waves¢ç program in 1992, we have sought out the most effective ways to grow and evolve this commitment, and the opportunities are endless. Our business depends upon many elements ? people, environments, technologies, processes, and communities. We must continuously ensure that all of these are healthy, efficient, and nurtured, for years to come; and that our guests feel good about choosing our cruise brands. Every day, around the world, our highly capable men and women from more than 136 countries work hard to deliver unforgettable vacation moments to our guests. Last year, our 41 ships sailed to nearly 500 destinations, contributing billions of dollars to local economies and supporting thousands of small businesses.  As we moved guests, ships, employees, and supplies around the world last year, we also moved closer to our 2015 sustainability goals:
Richard D. Fain Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.
We also met unexpected challenges in 2013. Everything we do starts with our employees and we are committed to helping to protect the communities where they live. In late 2013, when Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines, home to more than 12,000 of our employees, we reached out to help by partnering with World Vision¡¯s on-the-ground operation and activating our employee relief fund.  I invite you to learn more about our progress and ongoing efforts in this report. Always looking ahead, we continue to strive toward achieving and evolving our goals. Like the horizon where the ocean meets the sky, our commitment to protecting the environments and communities in which we operate keeps us moving forward, adjusting our sails, remaining steadfast, and charting our course toward a more sustainable future.
? Not only did we implement processes to repurpose 100% of the offloaded, non-hazardous waste from the two largest ships in the world, Oasis of the Seas¢ç and Allure of the Seas¢ç, we did the same on 10 more of our ships sailing from Florida. ? We also began repurposing 100% of the hazardous/ special waste from seven of those 12 ships. We plan to continue to evolve this in 2014, and I look forward to reporting on our next round of accomplishments in this area. ? While we continue to work toward our 33% greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal for 2015, we reached 21%, as a result of improvements in our technologies, operations, and ship design. ? Labadee, our private destination in Haiti, achieved the industry¡¯s ? and RCL¡¯s ? second Gold Level EcoCertification for sustainable tourism.

451,Royal Caribbean Cruises,3,USA,"This is our seventh annual sustainability report, and this is our second year adopting the internationally recognized GRI G4 reporting guidelines. It reflects input from both internal and external experts, who helped us prioritize reporting of social, economic and environmental topics that are deeper and broader than ever before. It contains detailed information on our 2014 results; I will call out a few of the most pertinent ones here. 
 ?  In November 2014, we launched Quantum of the Seas, our 43rd ship, which incorporated the most advanced design practices for environmental efficiency ever. Quantum offers best-ever energy efficiency, state-of-the-art waste treatment? and not a single incandescent light bulb.
 ?  Our advanced emissions purification project got underway in 2014 ? a process that will result in the retrofitting of 19 older ships with innovative technology that removes up to 97 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions before they can be released into the air. 
 ?  We also continued to make progress toward our 2015 Save the Waves goals: exceeding our waste-to-landfill reduction target one year ahead of schedule and achieving an additional 1.3% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per available cruise passenger days. 
 ?  And we advanced our commitment to destination stewardship with the launch of the Sustainable Destinations Alliance for the Americas ? the largest public and private effort to focus on destination sustainability in the Americas and the Caribbean.
But even as 2014 goes into the books, we must continue to challenge ourselves to do better. As of this writing we are planning new ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and designing updated Save the Waves goals for the next decade.
Delivering on these commitments is a technical challenge. More importantly, it is a call to action for all of the dedicated men and women of RCL, who must bring our determination to life every day, everywhere we sail. I invite you to learn more.
Every day, around the world, our highly capable men and women from more than 137 countries work hard to deliver unforgettable vacation moments to our guests onboard our 43 ships and across nearly 500 destinations. It is the steadfast commitment of our employees that make all efforts described in the Report possible. 
I invite you to learn more about our progress and ongoing efforts on our journey to truly make a difference and achieve measurable impact.
At Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the oceans are part of who we are. On our 43 ships, 60,000 crew members host more than 5,000,000 guests on cruise vacations each year. Earning our living at sea gives us all a sense of responsibility about sustainable business practices. The focus is not new: our mantra is continuous improvement and we continuously seek to advance our safety and environmental practices. We have made real progress ? but the journey is never-ending.

458,Sempra Energy,3,USA,"At Sempra Energy¢ç, our strategic focus is on growing profitably and responsibly, creating long-term value for our shareholders. To be successful, we know we must provide safe and reliable service to our millions of customers in North and South America and continue to grow our business in a sustainable way. We are developing natural gas liquefaction and export facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast; expanding our portfolio of solar and wind facilities; building new energy infrastructure in Mexico, including several natural gas pipelines; and enhancing safety and reliability in all of our businesses. 
There are three keys to carrying out our mission successfully:
? Managing risk: The energy infrastructure we develop and operate is contracted for the long term, limiting our exposure to the volatility of the markets in which we do business.
? Pursuing cleaner sources of energy: We believe that demand for clean energy will continue to rise. When we develop and procure renewable energy and deliver clean natural gas, we can meet the energy needs of our customers while reducing our impact on the environment.
? Developing our people and strengthening our stakeholder relationships: We work hard to serve our customers; develop and support our employees; forge alliances with our business partners; collaborate with our suppliers; and respond effectively to the needs of the communities where we do business.I feel fortunate to lead a team  of outstanding employees  who bring passion and professionalism to their  jobs every day.

613,Sempra Energy,4,USA,"At Sempra Energy, we work to deliver robust growth within our three primary platforms ? U.S. utilities; international utilities; and long-term-contracted energy infrastructure (including liquefied natural gas [LNG], pipelines and renewable energy).
Our performance over the long term is influenced by the people who have a stake in our business ? and their priorities, including:
? Our 32 million customers, who want clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy.
? Our 17,000 employees, who seek a work environment with the opportunity for growth and professional development.
? Our shareholders, who expect excellence in our operations, risk management and financial results.
We continue to meet the needs of these key stakeholders by remaining true to our core strengths: keeping safety as the top priority throughout our operations; maintaining reliable, excellent customer service; executing on a sound growth strategy; and living our core values with high ethical standards.
Carrying out these activities is at the very heart of our corporate responsibility. Yet we can and do face challenges. 
In late October 2015, a natural gas leak was discovered at the Southern California Gas Company¡¯s Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility outside Los Angeles. SoCalGas stopped the leak in February 2016 and continues to work with regulators, public officials and the local community to mitigate the leak¡¯s impacts and to work to safely bring the facility back online. We recognize the disruption the leak caused to the community surrounding the Aliso Canyon facility. And we remain committed to operating our businesses and serving our stakeholders in a responsible and responsive manner. 
As I look to the future, I see an abundance of opportunity for our company, with potential expansion of our LNG facilities, new natural gas and electric transmission infrastructure in Mexico and South America, and organic growth in our U.S. and international utilities.
I am confident we will succeed, in large part because we recognize the interconnectedness of our people, priorities and performance.

461,Sigma-Aldrich,1,USA,"Sigma-Aldrich delivered record sales, profits and free cash flow in 2012 and its 38th consecutive year of growth in earnings per share. Despite macroeconomic headwinds related to research funding and the volatility in some of the commercial and industrial markets we serve, our teams were able to rise to the occasion and deliver these record results. The Company¡¯s long-standing commitment to operational excellence and customer intimacy played a key role in these accomplishments.
 
In recent years, sales to customers who use our products in clinical diagnostics, environmental testing and other industrial applications have grown significantly and now represent nearly a quarter of our total sales. To best meet the needs of these customers, we announced the launch of a new Applied business unit in November 2012 which combined portions 
Finallyof the Research and SAFC Commercial business units. By working more closely with our customers, we are expanding our offering of products and technologies that provide solutions for researchers and industrial customers focused on climate change, water quality, environmental protection and enhancing the efficiency of alternative energy technologies.
Progress on our Global Citizenship Initiative (GC1015) goals continued to meet or exceed expectations in 2012.  For a number of our goals we already have exceeded more than 50% of the target.  This progress was driven by strategic, enterprise-wide efforts to engage key areas of the business such as Engineering, EH&S and R&D in driving improvements. In 2012, we achieved a 10% intensity reduction in CO2 emissions and also made significant progress in reducing water usage in our operations.  Our investments in increased water efficiency yielded another year of absolute water use reductions and a 8% improvement over our 2011 performance.  All told, we have reduced our water usage by more than 500,000 cubic meters annually since 2009.  We continue investing in energy efficiency as part of our 10 Facilities Project, which reduces our energy requirements and decreases our carbon emissions to mitigate potential climate change effects.
 
We released the Sigma-Aldrich Supplier Code of Conduct in 2012, which extends our expectations for environmental and social responsibility and governance to our supply chain, setting the stage for a more thorough engagement on sustainability with our suppliers.   Sigma-Aldrich also became a signatory of the UN Global Compact.  The UN Global Compact provides a baseline for the manner in which companies should operate in regard to human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.
We reached another milestone in 2012 through our Greener Alternatives platform by introducing an enhanced tool for providing customers greater visibility into our more environmentally friendly products.  This tool provides quantitative information on how we are improving the environmental footprint of our products through reformulation, while retaining superior performance and quality.Finally, our Social Responsibility strategy for giving and volunteerism began to take shape in the form of a clear roadmap for increasing our employees¡¯ involvement in their communities.  We also increased the focus on our three financial philanthropic investment focus areas:  STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) Education, Scientific Research and Economic Development through Science.  We are executing strategies to develop more ways for our employees to get involved in their communities in the aforementioned areas through structured opportunities that leverage skills based volunteering.
I am very pleased to note that our Global Citizenship efforts were recognized for excellence in both environmental sustainability and social responsibility this past year.  The CDP acknowledged Sigma-Aldrich¡¯s effort in carbon reporting with a listing of our Company on its Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. This was Sigma-Aldrich¡¯s first appearance on the index and we tied for the highest score of all companies in the US S&P 500 Materials sector.  We were also recognized on Newsweek¡¯s Green Rankings for the second consecutive year and were named to the inaugural Civic 50 - a list of the 50 most civically minded companies in the U.S.  
 
We are encouraged by the possibilities that our Global Citizenship platform brings to our employees, the business, and our customers.  The continuing strain on global resources reinforces a clear need to use those resources more responsibly and highlights the challenge of finding ways to minimize our environmental impact.  We believe this challenge can be met through science and that is why we continue to focus on our mission of enabling scientists to improve the quality of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
462,Sigma-Aldrich,2,USA,"Each year I appreciate having this opportunity to share with you how our 9,000-plus employees are working to make the world a cleaner, healthier, safer place to live.  And every year I¡¯m proud to report on how our employees are helping us live our mission of enabling science to improve the quality of life.  We have a range of programs in place to help us achieve this mission from the delivery of products that use fewer natural resources, to the engineering of more efficient packaging solutions that reduce waste, to engaging our communities in sharing the importance of science education. 
 
2013 was an exciting year for Sigma-Aldrich.  We recorded our 39th year of consecutive growth in earnings per share.  We realigned our Company into three market-facing business units:  Research, Applied and SAFC Commercial focused on the unique needs of research laboratory customers; diagnostic and testing and industrial customers; and pharmaceutical and electronics manufacturers respectively.  This transition helped contribute to a 7% increase in net income and a 19% increase in free cash flow with 4% organic sales growth.  
 
Along with our financial success, our Global Citizenship efforts yielded very positive results.  We made significant headway on our Global Citizenship Initiative ? 
GC1015 We once again outperformed our expectations with respect to water use, posting an absolute reduction of 111,000 cubic meters of water.  This represents a total reduction of more than 650,000 cubic meters of annual water usage since 2009.  Our energy initiatives showed positive signs despite weather driven spikes in natural gas use that drove our total energy usage above our goal for 2013.  I am also very pleased with the excellent improvements we made in electricity usage, which has been a key focus since we launched our 10 Facilities project.  The absolute reduction of electricity by four million kilowatt hours was a significant accomplishment and it makes me confident we are headed in the right direction in mitigating our carbon footprint.  
 
One of the biggest impacts we have on the environment is to help our customers reduce the environmental impact of their own research and development activities through the use of greener alternative products.  These products are gaining in popularity so much so that we recently launched a greener alternatives identifier on our website making it easier for researchers to make greener purchasing decisions.  
 
We have 10 Centers of Green Chemistry Excellence around the world, enabling us to increase our focus on building a talent bench and mindset of resource efficiency and waste reduction.  Our team is seeing success in the development of innovative, environmentally-friendly solutions to some of the most common problems facing researchers today.  
 
We enhanced our commitment to the community through increased philanthropic contributions in our three focus areas for giving: STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Education, Scientific Research and Economic Development through Science.  Our employees have joined this effort by sharing their skill and experience in classrooms around the world, bringing practical science applications to thousands 
FROM OUR PRESIDENT & CEO
of students through our recently launched Sigma-Aldrich Science Partners Program.  These efforts are yielding results not just in the classroom. Our employees are reporting stronger engagement at work after participating in these sessions.
 
In 2013, we were once again recognized by some of the leading environmental and social responsibility indexes in the world.  We added recognition from the Dow Jones Sustainability Index to our list of accomplishments and were named for a second time to CDP¡¯s Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index.  We were also recognized by the Civic 50 for the second year in a row and received the top ranking in the Materials sector for our strong community engagement efforts.  Additionally, we were recognized by inclusion on both the NSYE Euronext Vigeo 120 and the MSCI World SRI Index.  All of this recognition is a testament to the great work our employees are doing.  We believe that the successes we are achieving in our sustainability program serve as a key benchmark not only for our sector, but also for the business world at large ? and this incentivizes us to take our efforts to new levels as we work to solve some of the world¡¯s biggest challenges.  
Global Citizenship at Sigma-Aldrich is a differentiator.  In an increasingly complex business environment, we are able to set ourselves apart by partnering with our customers not only on science, but on delivering science in a more sustainable fashion.  We have the unique opportunity to positively affect our environment by helping scientists tackle their problems with creative solutions.  We know from the work we do every day that together Sigma-Aldrich and science have the potential to change the world.

463,Starwood Hotels and Resorts,2,USA,"We are living in a time of unprecedented global change. A time that we have dubbed the Age of Great Change. Globalization, middle-class growth, and the acceleration of digital connectivity around the world are remaking society in dynamic and exciting ways. At the same time, these forces of change are bringing with them new challenges for the global ecosystem.
We view these challenges not as roadblocks but as a call to action. This is why we have made global citizenship a key to our strategy, practices, and culture. At Starwood, we have a shared belief that people want a better way to experience the world. We view our work in sustainability and social responsibility as our commitment to making sure there is a better world to experience. This first-ever Global Citizenship report is our way of sharing with you some of the many things that we¡¯ve been working on.
Despite long-standing efforts across our hotels,  we don¡¯t pretend to have all the answers. It may be that someday when we look back, our efforts today will seem like just the beginning. But one lesson we can learn from history is that it takes time for society to change in response to a new worldview. It also requires a bold start with a vision toward the future. 
Shaping our future is something we all share together at Starwood. We can focus our efforts in three ways: 1) taking direct action to reduce our impact on the environment; 2) collaborating with our owners and partners; and 3) tapping into the passion of our associates. 
Taking Action In the Age of Great Change, sustainability is no  longer about ¡°doing good¡± but rather about  ¡°doing what is urgently needed.¡± Climate change  is already having devastating consequences around the globe. Across our company, we see how climate change is harming many local communities, and we¡¯re compelled to play our  part in protecting the planet. We¡¯ve laid out goals to reduce our environmental impact and offer sustainable products and services to our  customers and guests. 
These goals aren¡¯t just numbers. They represent our commitment to doing the right thing around the world. We are convinced that achieving these goals can help prove that doing good for the environment makes sound business sense. 
Collaboration We are leading the industry in applying our  environmental and social standards uniformly across all our owned, managed, and franchised properties. Many of our hotels are independently owned, so collaboration with our hotel owners is critical. We were the first to take this inclusive approach with owners. 
We also work closely with suppliers, community partners, and NGOs. We value not only their partnership but also their feedback. We know that we¡¯re not always the experts, so we listen to those who are. We are a culture that thrives on change and innovation, so we¡¯re always interested in new, different, and better ways to do things.
Associate Passion The global community of 181,400 Starwood associates is a force for change. They possess an enduring commitment to, and pride in, our Global Citizenship efforts. Through their individual pursuit of a better way to experience the world, they offer not just inspiration but ideas and input on how  we can collectively make a positive difference in the communities where we live, work, and play.  By ensuring our associates around the world are encouraged and supported in their efforts, we  can nurture an even stronger Starwood culture  of responsibility and giving for years to come.  
This inaugural Global Citizenship report  outlines our efforts to date in what is a multiyear transformation of how we do business. We¡¯re  on a journey, and we want our stakeholders  to come with us, to challenge us, and to help  us go further. Please send us an email at  global.citizenship@starwoodhotels.com and tell us what you think.

Starwood¡¯s Board of Directors proudly supports and  encourages Global Citizenship at Starwood.Our Global Citizenship efforts are some of the most important work we  can do as a business; they are also the part of my job that I¡¯m the most proud of at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Sustainability and social responsibility touch every aspect of the company and help us execute  a global growth strategy while mitigating our business risk, protecting our environment, promoting community vitality, supporting our associates, and enhancing the guest experience. It¡¯s through Global Citizenship that we belong to something bigger. We made great strides in 2014, and I¡¯m  pleased to share our most recent progress as we continue to make  a better world to experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
614,Starwood Hotels and Resorts,4,USA,"¡°Doing the right thing¡± is at the core of who we are, and Global Citizenship remained a priority for
Starwood in 2015. It was business as usual for our properties, associates and leaders as we focused on
Starwood¡¯s environmental and social responsibility strategy and goals, even during a ¡°business unusual¡±
year for our company.
We made significant progress across many areas of our business as we worked to protect the
environment, promote community vitality and mitigate our business risk. We are proud of our 2015
accomplishments and would like to share a few key highlights:
? Starwood continues to drive toward our industry-leading 30/20 by 20 goals to reduce energy
consumption by 30%, greenhouse gas emissions by 30% and water usage by 20% by 2020.
At the end of 2015, we were more than 50% of the way to our energy goal, almost 75% of the way
to our emissions goal and nearly 90% of the way to our water goal, and we¡¯ve saved our owners
millions of dollars in utility costs in the process. Additionally, we went the extra step to create a
water risk framework that gives us a comprehensive strategy for development and operating in
locations with significant water risk issues.
? As part of Starwood¡¯s commitment to Sustainable Food & Beverage, we introduced a
comprehensive on-property Sustainable Seafood toolkit, including back-of-house collateral,
a resource library and a procurement pocket guide. We also outlined our long-term strategy
and goals in a public-facing Seafood Position Statement.
? Starwood¡¯s commitment to Workplace Readiness ? both through philanthropic support and our
recruitment practices ? earned us recognition by the National Fund for Workforce Solutions as a
2015 ¡°Young Adult Employer Champion¡± for the student internship program we created at our
Stamford, CT, headquarters office.
? Starwood celebrated our 20-year partnership with UNICEF, a now-global relationship that began
in our European division in 1995 with the launch of Check Out For Children¢â. Over the past two
decades, Starwood hotels, associates and guests have raised more than $30M to improve the lives
of vulnerable children around the world.
? We launched an industry-leading Children¡¯s Rights Assessment in Mexico, led by the Starwood
Foundation and UNICEF, to fulfill our promise of support for communities where we operate.
At Starwood, we realize the importance of reducing our environmental footprint, supporting the
communities in which we operate and bringing financial value to our owners and shareholders, and we
are therefore committed to being an exemplary corporate citizen. We are confident that the efforts of our
hotels and associates will continue to make a difference in the communities where we work and live.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
465,State Street Corp,2,USA,"At State Street, we know that being a responsible
corporate citizen is essential to the success of our
business ? and our strategy to create value for our
clients, employees, shareholders and communities.
Our stakeholders have told us they care deeply
about corporate responsibility (CR), particularly as it
relates to economic responsibility, social consciousness
and environmental sustainability. This report
examines these three aspects of our CR strategy in
detail, and I¡¯d like to touch on each.
Economic Responsibility
We partner with institutional investors globally,
helping them better serve the financial needs of
their clients and achieve success within a challenging
and increasingly complex economic and
regulatory environment. We¡¯re committed to creating
economic value, not only for our clients but
for society in general. We apply financial expertise
to make investments with both economic
and social benefits, including tax-advantaged
affordable housing in the US, small-scale venture
capital funds that fuel economic growth and job
creation in underserved US markets, and microfinance
investments benefiting hundreds of small
businesses around the world.
We believe it¡¯s our responsibility to engage with
issuers of securities on matters that affect shareholder
value, including environmental and social
issues. We do this primarily through extensive
dialogue with company management and boards,
and by encouraging clients to exercise their
ownership rights through proxy voting. Each year,
we vote approximately 14,000 proxies in 70
geographic markets around the world on behalf
of our clients, and we make our voting guidelines
and complete results available to clients.
Social Consciousness
We¡¯re committed to supporting the communities
in which we live and work. In 2013, we invested
nearly $20 million and 87,000 volunteer hours
in our communities ? 70 percent of which was
directed to education and workforce development
initiatives. By concentrating our giving, we
can have a greater impact and develop deeper
relationships with our community partners.
Expanding the diversity of our workforce is a very
important part of our talent management strategy.
We partner with local educational and charitable
organizations that train urban young people and
adults for corporate work experience, place them
in internships, and provide support services like
mentoring and counseling. Our Foundation also
partners with many of these organizations, complementing
our internship program with investment support. We¡¯re particularly proud of our partnership
with the Boston Private Industry Council (PIC),
which works closely with Boston Public School staff
to prepare students for employment through job
readiness workshops and career exploration programs.
Since 2008, State Street has employed
nearly 1,000 summer interns through PIC alone.
Strict adherence to the highest ethical standards
and all applicable laws and regulations is
a priority for us, as reflected in our values and
Standard of Conduct. In 2013, we developed a
new, global compliance enforcement procedure.
We also hired a new chief anti-money laundering
(AML) officer to join our Compliance
department in 2013, and in early 2014 we
named a new head of ethics responsible for
increasing ethical awareness and training.
Environmental Sustainability
Protecting and preserving our natural resources
helps us to increase efficiency, attract and retain
clients, save money, and engage employees. Our
Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Policy
(EPPP) guides conversations with suppliers about
reducing our impact on the environment. As we
evolve our corporate-wide environmental sustainability
program, we make an even greater impact
by directly involving our employees and giving them
tools to help reduce our environmental footprint.
We¡¯ve created an employee environmental sustainability
dashboard that measures factors like
commuting, tree plantings, composting and flexible
work solutions ? and provides solutions for reducing
consumption and emissions. Our Office of
Environmental Sustainability sets our overall environmental
sustainability strategy and coordinates
cross-company engagement through regional EcoAdvisory
Councils. At the local level, we have a total
of 18 Green Teams globally to provide opportunities
for employees to get involved ? from volunteering,
to recycling and energy-efficient commuting. Read
more about Green Teams on page 54.
The Way Ahead
Corporate responsibility is an essential part of
who we are, what we believe and how we act.
We¡¯re proud of the value we are delivering to
our stakeholders and the positive impact of our
efforts. We believe we have a strong foundation,
a clear strategy for the way ahead, and the right
people and processes to get us there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,State Street Corp,3,USA,"At State Street, corporate responsibility is an integral part of who we are, what we believe and how we act. Being
a responsible corporate citizen is essential to the long-term success of our business, and we¡¯re committed to
creating value not only for our employees, clients and shareholders, but also for society at large.
Our business is built on trust. Our clients expect us to serve them fairly, whether we are conducting transactions on
their behalf, servicing or managing their assets, or delivering advice. We know we must earn their trust every day.
Maintaining a trusted reputation starts with strict adherence to the highest ethical standards and all applicable
laws and regulations. In 2014, we significantly increased investment in our regulatory compliance and risk
management infrastructure and processes to respond to heightened regulatory requirements. And we partnered
with our clients to help them do the same. We also appointed a Chief Ethics Officer to lead our Ethics Office and
introduced a framework to strengthen ethical awareness, training and oversight, including enhanced compliance
monitoring and enforcement. We will continue to devote significant attention and resources to these areas in
2015, with the goal of making risk excellence a competitive strength for State Street.
Strengthening our communities
We know the success of our business is directly linked to the well-being of the communities where we live and
work, and we take great pride in contributing to the health and stability of our communities. In 2014, our State
Street Foundation invested $18.8 million in grants to nonprofit organizations around the world, including $3.3
million to match employee contributions to more than 2,000 charitable organizations. Our employees are
passionate about supporting social causes and giving back to their communities. During the year, more than a
fifth of our employees participated in company-approved volunteer activities, devoting more than 100,000 hours
of their time to charitable causes.
Just as we¡¯ve evolved from service provider to solutions partner with our clients, we¡¯re forging strategic
partnerships with nonprofit organizations to address critical social needs. We take a holistic approach to our
community relationships ? looking at the full picture of how we can support an organization, including financial
aid, employee volunteerism and board service.
Since 2010, we¡¯ve focused our charitable giving on education and workforce development. We partner with nonprofit
organizations to prepare young people and adults from low-income urban neighborhoods for professional
jobs, place them in internships, and provide mentoring and counseling support. We also work with these
community partners to identify candidates for internships and jobs at State Street. As a result, we¡¯ve increased
our pipeline of diverse talent. In 2014 we partnered with Year Up to provide more than 130 local youth with
internships. For our 2007 Year Up class of interns ? the first year we have data ? we hired 62 percent for fulltime
positions.
Operating responsibly
We took a number of steps in 2014 to demonstrate our commitment to operating our business responsiblyWe signed the United Nations Global Compact, a global initiative whose signatories share the conviction that
responsible business practices contribute to a more stable, equitable and inclusive global market and help build
prosperous societies. By signing the compact, we committed to align our business operations and strategy with
10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.
We continued to explore new ways to conserve resources and reduce waste at our facilities in support of our
targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water usage by 20 percent and send zero waste to landfills by
January 1, 2020. Twenty-one ¡°green teams¡± at our facilities around the world are working to engage their fellow
employees to promote environmentally friendly policies.Two more of our buildings attained ISO 14001 certification in 2014, bringing the number of our facilities with
this designation to 16. Our new Channel Center building in Boston, with its open work environment, energyefficient
use of natural light and access to green space, has become our global standard for new and redesigned
buildings.
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are important indicators of investment stability and
performance, so we devote considerable attention to analyzing how ESG factors affect client portfolios. At the
end of 2014, we were managing more than $200 billion in ESG assets for our clients. Late in the year, we
introduced the first low-carbon ETF product, designed to allow institutional investors to reduce exposure to
investments in companies with high-carbon emissions.

remain focused on our legacy of giving and service and our commitment to strong, healthy and safe communities.
And in today¡¯s era of unprecedented transparency around pricing and merchandising strategies, we believe it¡¯s
also important to be transparent in reporting our goals and progress around corporate responsibility.
Engaging with our team members, guests, shareholders and communities is vital to overcoming challenges
and meeting our goals for environmental sustainability, team member well-being, education and volunteerism ?
areas that are essential to the strength of the communities in which we operate worldwide and to the long-term
health of our business.
From our sourcing offices all over the world to our stores across the United States and now Canada, our team
is Target¡¯s single biggest competitive advantage. That¡¯s why we remain committed to creating workplaces that
include opportunities for advancement; an environment where everyone feels welcome, respected and valued;
and strong ethics training for our team members.
And to help ensure we have the talent to remain relevant and successful, we¡¯ve committed to helping children
reach their full potential and remain on track to meet our goal of giving $1 billion for education by the end of 2015.
We continued to advance our commitment to responsible sourcing and environmental sustainability in
2012 by ending the harmful practice of sandblasting denim; working with our pork-product vendors to ban
sow-gestation crates by 2022; committing to increase our organic food selection by 25 percent by the end of
2017; and making progress toward our goals of offering a 100-percent sustainable seafood selection in our
stores and reducing waste, water and greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2015.
Additionally, we are working to cut excess miles from our U.S. supply chain, limit packaging waste, and help
our guests increase their use of reusable shopping bags, which has reduced plastic-bag consumption in our
stores over the past four years.
Our approach to corporate responsibility has also played a significant role in our expansion into Canada.
Since announcing our plans for Target Canada in 2011, we¡¯ve built a strong Canadian team, pursued LEED
certification for the 124 stores we¡¯ll open this year, and directly engaged with our communities to provide the
best stores possible and help shape our giving and volunteerism efforts nationwide.

stakeholders. To us, character means conducting business with the highest standards
of honesty and integrity, and delivering on promises to customers, as we have for
more than 200 years. Character is also about contributing to a cleaner environment,
creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, and improving the community. This trait
is central to how The Hartford deals with the future and is part of our vision, which is
to be an exceptional company celebrated for financial performance, character, and
customer value.
To continually strengthen its culture of integrity, The Hartford has mandatory
ethics and compliance education for all employees, an online ethics discussion
forum, and avenues for employees to confidentially seek advice on ethical issues
or report cases of alleged misconduct.
Our character also includes a commitment to protecting the environment. In 2012,
Newsweek magazine ranked The Hartford the ¡°greenest¡± company in the U.S.
financial services industry for the second consecutive year. The company is also a
2012/2013 member of the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index and, for
the fifth year in a row, was included on the S&P 500 Carbon Disclosure Leadership
Index, recognizing The Hartford¡¯s corporate governance on climate-change
disclosure practices.
Another expression of our character is ensuring The Hartford is an inclusive place
where people can succeed because of their differences, not in spite of them. We know that innovation requires a variety of experiences and viewpoints, and that
the best way to meet the evolving needs of customers and partners is with a workforce
that mirrors the diversity of the marketplace.
We are also determined to drive positive and sustainable change in the communities
where we live and work. At the start of the decade, The Hartford announced a $7
million investment over five years to revitalize Hartford¡¯s Asylum Hill neighborhood.
We are partnering with community leaders to focus on strengthening neighborhoods,
educating children, developing outreach programs, and encouraging employees to
volunteer in the community.

thousands of hours to community volunteer work.
In June 2014, The Hartford committed $16 million over five years to
help small business owners succeed through its new Communities
with HART initiative. The first two investments include $1.25 million
to the Accion U.S. Network to benefit 500 small businesses and $1.5
million to Junior Achievement USA (JA) to support 100,000 students.
America¡¯s demographics are changing profoundly, with minorities
expected to exceed 50% of the U.S. population before 2050. At
The Hartford, we recognize the need for our workforce to mirror
the marketplace and our local communities, so we are accelerating
efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive work environment.
We are very proud of our Employee Resource Groups, voluntary
networks of employees who share their passion, expertise, and
diverse experiences, and act as the voice of their constituency
on behalf of colleagues, customers, partners, and the community.
In a sign of our progress, the Human Rights Campaign named
The Hartford a ¡°Best Place to Work for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and

393,The Hartford,3,USA,"At The Hartford, we believe that making a positive difference in the world isn¡¯t just a
nice thing to do ? it is a business imperative. Our success is inextricably tied to the
well-being of our customers, employees and the communities in which we work and
live. Accordingly, our focus must extend beyond the products and services we offer to
encompass our responsibilities as an employer, neighbor, and steward of the planet¡¯s
natural resources.
Our corporate responsibility commitments manifest themselves in the following
areas: Environment, Business, Community, and Employees.
ENVIRONMENT
As an insurance company, we understand the inherent risks that environmental
challenges present to people and communities. In response, we are reducing our own
impact on the environment and conserving natural resources, while reducing our operating costs in the process. BUSINESS
As a supporter of commerce and community, we are advocating
for entrepreneurship through educational programming, access
to loans, and encouraging re-employment and micro-enterprise.
We are also proud of the strong ethics, governance, and risk
management practices that are an ingrained part of who we are
and how we operate.
COMMUNITY
As a neighbor, we are fostering stability and vitality in the
communities in which we live and work by providing those in
need with access to food, shelter, and economic opportunity. We
are making a difference in each of these areas by targeting our
philanthropic support, partnering with like-minded national and
local organizations, and harnessing the power of our 17,500-person
workforce, mobilizing them to invest their time, talent and
generosity as community volunteers.
EMPLOYEES
As an employer, we are attracting the next generation of talent
we need to successfully compete in a dynamic and competitive
marketplace by building a diverse and inclusive culture, where
people are respected for who they are, recognized for how they
contribute, encouraged to make a positive difference in the world
around them, and celebrated for what they can become.We measure our success by the impacts we make ? such as jobs
created, small business loans initiated, greenhouse gas reductions
attained, employee volunteer hours logged and lives affected ? and
by the strength of our reputation for being a company that places
integrity above all else.
While we are proud of our progress, we know there is more to be
done. I invite you to read more in the report that follows about the
strong foundation we have built for the work ahead.

470,Thermo Fisher Scientific,1,USA,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is the world leader in serving science. Our mission ? to enable our customers
to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer ? perfectly captures our commitment to corporate social
responsibility and sustainable growth.
Globally, we provide state-of-the-art products and services that help our customers meet their own goals
for sustainable growth, from specialty diagnostic tests to improve patient care, to air-quality systems that
monitor stack emissions, to meters that ensure the safety of our drinking water. During 2012, we
launched a number of innovative new products that improve healthcare and the environment, including:
? Breakthrough advances in spectroscopy that help research scientists improve
efficiency during experiments and accelerate results,
? Continuous particulate monitors that measure microscopic airborne particles
to assess the quality of the air we breathe, and
? Bioprocessing media and systems to help biotech companies develop
vaccines that dramatically reduce illness, especially among children.
I¡¯m also pleased with the progress we¡¯re making to reduce the impact our own
company has on the environment. For example, last year Thermo Fisher sites around
the world recycled more than 8,000 metric tons of waste, minimizing the amount sent
to landfills. We also supported renewable energy and lowered energy costs by installing
our first onsite photovoltaic panels ? with more planned for 2013. Several locations
have donated excess or obsolete equipment to schools and research labs. This helps us reduce unnecessary
inventory and helps student labs expand their research capabilities.
Of course, these accomplishments and many others are due to the commitment of our colleagues
around the world ? the 39,000 women and men who fulfil our mission every day. In turn, we strive to
foster a respectful and inclusive workplace environment in which employees can grow, develop and
contribute at their full potential. During the year we reaffirmed our commitment to diversity and inclusion
and its role in helping us to achieve our Vision for 2020. We recently established African Heritage and
Women¡¯s Employee Resource Groups to provide additional opportunities for networking, mentoring and
growth.
As the world leader in serving science, we also take seriously our responsibility to give back to communities
through our time, philanthropy and in-kind donations. During 2012, Thermo Fisher employees
volunteered nearly 12,000 hours to support company-sponsored programs that demonstrate our
community involvement, with an emphasis on science education. Just a few of these efforts included:
? Donating laboratory equipment for distribution to schools in Spain that lacked funding for
science equipment.
? Hosting a competition in China that encouraged students to identify innovative ways to promote
environmental protection and sustainable communities.? Providing high school students in Lithuania with a state-of-the-art mobile biotechnology lab
for exploring scientific instruments and methods.
? Mentoring underserved students in the U.S. to help close the achievement gaps for college
placement in math and science education.
Thermo Fisher Scientific is a company built on commitment: to serving our communities, to protecting
the environment and to meeting the needs of our customers in a challenging global economy. This is
what sets us apart as the world leader in our industry today, and will fuel our growth for years to come ?
to the benefit of all our key stakeholders. In a complex world, our mission is simple. And by continuing to
fulfill it, I have no doubt that we will achieve our Vision for 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

our customers to make the world healthier,
cleaner and safer, and we work to fulfill this

responsibility (CSR) strategy is grounded in business
sustainability, because sound business practices and
operational excellence are key to our growth, now

employee engagement and to hiring, developing and
advancing the very best talent in the industry. And,
we support the communities where we live and work
through philanthropic giving that makes a difference
in education, health and other critical societal needs.
A Culture of Operational Excellence
We continuously improve our operations through
our PPI Business System, which stands for Practical
Process Improvement. By leveraging PPI, we have
embedded continuous improvement within our
culture, from reducing usage of fuels to increased
recycling. Through these initiatives we find opportunities
to improve our performance as it relates to
CSR. At the same time, we provide our customers
with products and services that help them address
some of the world¡¯s most pressing challenges. For
example, our ion chromatography systems are used
by government agencies to monitor the impact of
global climate change.
Engaging Our Employees
Our global family of more than 50,000 colleagues
makes us The World Leader in Serving Science.
United by a shared set of values, we work together
to help our customers accelerate research, solve
complex analytical challenges, improve patient
diagnostics and meet their goals for innovation

grow and develop in their careers. For example,
we¡¯ve strengthened our culture through innovative
workplace programs, such as our Women¡¯s,
African Heritage, Millennials¡¯ and Veteran¡¯s Employee

Giving Back to People and Communities
As the unrivaled leader in our industry, we embrace
our responsibility to give back. For me, there is no
greater reward than helping to support and inspire
the next generation of scientists. Through our charter
philanthropic program and hands-on volunteering,
we promote education in STEM subjects?science,
technology, engineering and math?for students
from the earliest grades through advanced university
programs.
In this report, we¡¯ll share more of these successes

472,Tiffany & Co.,1,USA,"Tiffany & Co.¡¯s promise to our customers is to be makers
of beauty and creators of joy, a commitment which our
artisans and sales professionals uphold every day. Tiffany¡¯s
promise to the world is to protect its beauty, nurture its
people and conduct our business with care. Nearly one year
into my journey with Tiffany & Co., I am proud to present
this accounting of our achievements in sustainability.
Sustainability lies at the heart of the Tiffany & Co. brand?
it¡¯s both our legacy and our future. The Tiffany customer
who passes our jewelry from generation to generation
cherishes these treasures for their beautiful, enduring
designs and their masterful craftsmanship. Our customers
place great value on sustainability. They want to know
where their jewelry comes from, how it is made and how
the jewelry-making process impacts the planet as well as
its people and communities.
Tiffany & Co. holds this kind of transparency dear and,
through this creation of shared value, we have a unique
opportunity to build meaningful, lasting relationships
with our customers. We are committed to sharing more
with them?and all of our stakeholders?about what,
exactly, Tiffany is doing to achieve sustainability for our
business and for the planet as we very broadly define that
goal: enriching the people and places we reach through our
business; minimizing our environmental impact; improving
industry-wide practices; and channeling the power of the
Tiffany brand as a force for positive change in the world.
In all of the past year¡¯s work, three areas stand out to me
as opportunities that Tiffany & Co. has most successfully
harnessed to advance sustainability and meet?even
exceed?the expectations of our customers.
The first area is the responsible sourcing of the raw
materials that go into our jewelry. From known mines
that meet Tiffany standards to our in-house cutting
and polishing operations to our vertically integrated
supply chain, we aim to achieve diamond traceablility.
Through this model, we are able to demonstrate Tiffany¡¯s
exemplary standards for environmental and social
responsibility at every step of our sourcing and jewelrymaking
around the world.
The second area is conservation. For more than 180
years, Tiffany & Co. has been a leader in both celebrating
and protecting the Earth¡¯s wild creatures and pristine
landscapes. In 2017, we pushed forward with our work
to protect irreplaceable natural wonders like Bristol Bay,
Alaska, and the two dozen U.S. national monuments at
risk of a rollback in land protections. In Africa, we are
working to protect endangered elephants through our
Tiffany Save the Wild collection and our partnership with
the Elephant Crisis Fund. The Tiffany & Co. Foundation
continues its ambitious grantmaking to expand marine
protected areas in critical ocean ecosystems.
The third area of accomplishment is one that I, as one
of the newer members of the Tiffany & Co. team, am
personally passionate about: the nurturing of talent,
diversity and inclusion for our people. As I have traveled
among our workshops and sales floors, it has become clear
to me that Tiffany¡¯s greatest assets are the individuals who
invest their careers with a company that invests in them.
Our inclusive workplace culture encourages people across
all levels and backgrounds to contribute ideas that drive
the success of our company. I am committed to growing
and institutionalizing our diversity, inclusion and careerdevelopment
initiatives, with a focus on women, working
parents, cross-cultural fluency, the LGBTQ community and
people of color.
As social and environmental issues evolve, we will
continue to uphold Tiffany¡¯s place at the vanguard of
responsible business and periodically dedicate time to
evaluate what matters most to our company, our partners
and our shareholders. Over the next year, we will have
conversations with key stakeholders to refine our priorities
and identify the best ways to embed sustainability even
more deeply throughout our company.
We focus a great deal on legacy and luxury at
Tiffany & Co. There is no greater luxury than being
able to gift future generations with unspoiled
natural wonders and wide-open opportunity. This
is the true power of a great business, and this is
the legacy Tiffany is building. I am excited to see
how far we can go together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
474,Tiffany & Co.,3,USA,"As Tiffany & Co.¡¯s new CEO, I am proud to assume
leadership of a company with such a rich heritage,
iconic designs and a legacy of sustainability and
corporate responsibility.
Our global sustainability efforts are both a priority for
the Company and for me personally. As a revered house
of luxury and an iconic brand, the world looks to us to
define trends and set standards?from the innovative
and unapologetically modern style of the Tiffany T
collection to rigorous purity requirements adopted for
the sterling silver and platinum standards. Today, I see
an opportunity and responsibility for Tiffany & Co. to
set the standard for sustainable luxury. Ours will be an
example for others to follow in the materials we choose
to use, as well as those we don¡¯t, in the way we treat our
employees and in the impact we have on the earth. We
need to make sure we honor the earth, which provides
us with so much beauty, by doing everything we can to
leave it whole.
One of my earliest actions as CEO was to appoint
Tiffany & Co.¡¯s first Chief Sustainability Officer. I
believe that sustainability is a critical element of a
successful business strategy and that sustainable
principles should be woven into every department¡¯s
responsibilities. Under my leadership, sustainability
will be a significant priority for Tiffany & Co. As such,
the Chief Sustainability Officer reports directly to me
and is positioned to advance a cohesive, integrated
agenda in this important area.
As part of the Company¡¯s sustainability strategy, I have
asked our business leaders to set aggressive goals to
advance sustainability practices. These goals will serve
to further align our sustainability practices with our
business growth strategies.
I am also pleased to renew Tiffany & Co.¡¯s commitment
to, and declare my personal support of, the Ten
Principles of the United Nations Global Compact
in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment
and Anti-Corruption.
Looking ahead, promoting and supporting responsible
mining practices continues to be our greatest area of
impact and opportunity. We are committed to working
with our suppliers, the jewelry and luxury industries, the
nonprofit community, the mining sector and others to
drive progress. Through leadership and participation in
the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA),
we are helping to make significant progress towards a
global standard for responsible large-scale mining.
I am delighted that IRMA¡¯s draft standard is being
piloted in 2015.
During 2014 there were significant expansions at
Tiffany & Co. We opened stunning new retail locations,
from a store on the Champs-Elys?es in Paris to our
first store in Russia. We also debuted Tiffany Swiss
Watch operations in Switzerland, a polishing facility
in the Dominican Republic and our newest Laurelton
Diamonds facility in Cambodia. This growth in
production capacity helps us ensure greater control
over the responsible manner in which our extraordinary
products are designed and crafted.
In 2014, Tiffany & Co. also began another important
initiative?to reframe our diversity and inclusion
strategy. We have long held diversity as a core value.
Being a global organization, we are excited about the
potential opportunities that can be capitalized on
from a talent and business perspective. My senior
management team and I are committed to this initiative
and we look forward to sharing our progress.
As I begin my journey as CEO, I am humbled when I
think of Tiffany¡¯s journey from a New York City fancy
goods store to a global luxury house operating in 32
countries?a remarkable evolution. Many things have
changed over the course of these 178 years, but one
thing remains constant: the natural world is a source
of inspiration for Tiffany designers, employees and
customers. Over the last two decades, this connection
to nature blossomed as Tiffany & Co. led the industry
in responsible business practices. I am proud to lead
a company with such a strong legacy of responsibility.
But let me be clear?I am committed to going beyond
this tradition to accelerate our sustainability progress and industry leadership. I encourage our customers to
expect excellence from us always.
I invite you to read about our environmental and social
commitments in our fifth annual Sustainability Report. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
618,Tiffany & Co.,4,USA," For the leader of any American company who genuinely believes in the responsibility of business to build a more sustainable future, these are especially difficult times. Tragically, many members of Congress are intent on undoing decades of environmental progress, they deny the devastating costs of climate change and are unwilling to protect our public lands for the benefit of all citizens. This should compel business leaders to speak and act more directly, and with greater urgency than ever before. I believe that the vast majority of our stakeholders? customers, employees, shareholders, business partners and the communities in which we operate?care deeply about these issues. I also know that speaking and acting to address these issues is both a business and a moral imperative. Responsible behavior is an implicit part of the Tiffany brand promise. Along with artful design, great craftsmanship and gracious service, it is a critical dimension of our competitive advantage and defines the relationship with our customer. We design and craft our jewelry and objects to stand the test of time. Clearly we owe the same commitment to the natural world that inspires our work and provides the precious materials we use. That is why we are absolutely committed to operating a rigorously controlled, transparent and ethical supply chain that can assure that promise of responsibility. Fortunately, Tiffany & Co. is not alone. A growing number of companies are joining together to make it clear to our elected officials that we stand with the majority of America¡¯s citizens?and the world?who believe in a shared responsibility to address the environmental threats we face. We categorically reject the fiction, created by those who stand to gain from inaction or retrenchment, that there is any meaningful conflict between jobs and economic prosperity on the one hand and environmental responsibility on the other. For the past 20 years, we at Tiffany have demonstrated that we can grow our company, create thousands of manufacturing jobs and behave with integrity.
Even though the political landscape has changed, our approach to running a socially and environmentally responsible business has not. We are proud to do our part to help contain greenhouse gas emissions, and given the catastrophic consequences of failing to address global warming, we must do more.  That¡¯s why we raised our voice even louder this year, joining with many companies in an appeal to President Trump not to abandon the Paris Agreement. With other companies, we added our name to an open letter outlining the importance of the climate agreement to U.S. businesses, and we punctuated this request with our own ad in The New York Times. We are backing this advocacy with a renewed focus on reducing impacts on climate change in our business and value chain. Tiffany also remains committed to protecting our public lands from destructive mining activities. We oppose the proposed rollback of national monument designations for the financial benefit of a few and to the detriment of the many who value the extraordinary natural and cultural treasures these lands contain. We believe the mining industry should embrace a new, thoughtful approach to public lands, and we support legislative reform that holds mines accountable for responsible closure and ensures the cleanup of abandoned mines. Tiffany also continues to oppose mining in special places like Bristol Bay, Alaska, where the Pebble Mine threatens one of the world¡¯s greatest remaining wild salmon fisheries. Despite these challenges, we have many reasons for optimism. We are making great progress on our work to build a genuine, independent certification system for responsible mine development and operation. Together with a committed group of mining companies, downstream users and civil society representatives, we have collectively crafted a set of robust standards that, when implemented, will ensure a more responsible mining future. The work that remains is to enlist the support of our peers in the jewelry space and beyond, to incorporate these standards. Under such a system, we believe mining can take its rightful place as an environmentally responsible engine of social and economic development. In the absence of meaningful regulations, voluntary standards and collaboration across sectors are the best means to advance change and improve practices in the long term. 
Our  work is not done. Today, our task is bigger than that of  any one company or any one industry. The business community must exercise the full strength of its voice to advocate for the protection of this planet¡¯s natural resources and for action that will lead to a stable climate. This advocacy, coupled with long-term action, can demonstrate that the protection of the environment and a growing economy are not mutually exclusive. We all have the opportunity to demonstrate the true power of business as a force for social and environmental good, and change the course of the planet for generations to come.

476,United Rentals,1,USA,"It¡¯s an honor and a pleasure to present our second
corporate responsibility report, the first since our
merger with RSC. Standing Proud is an apt theme
for this report because we have so much to be
proud of?not the least of which is how we have
successfully combined two stellar organizations
to form a single company with world-class
prominence. Today we¡¯re more unified and focused
than ever before.
We have a lot to be proud of in terms of corporate
responsibility, too. In a very short time, we have
become a leading force for sustainability within
the equipment-rental industry. We aim to serve our
customers with innovative approaches that help
them work safer, faster and greener.
Two great examples of this are our Total Control
and FAST programs. Total Control helps customers
save up to one-third on total equipment costs while
reducing fuel use and carbon emissions. FAST
enables us to deliver and pick up equipment safely,
quickly and efficiently, improving our customers¡¯
operational efficiencyWithin United Rentals, a big source of pride in 2013
was the launch of the United Compassion Fund,
our first-ever employee-funded program designed
to help fellow employees in times of unexpected
hardship. This program is truly an example of the
spirit and caring of our United Rentals familyWe¡¯re also proud to support and employ military
veterans, who make up 11% of our US workforce.
In our experience, veterans epitomize our core
strengths of cooperation, discipline and a strong
work ethic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
477,United Rentals,3,USA,"Our company often emphasizes that we provide solutions, not merely
equipment. To our customers, it means that we¡¯re invested in their success.
To our employees, suppliers and stockholders, our solutions take the form
of a vibrant and fnancially stable company; one that creates opportunities
and adds value to our business relationships. And at the highest level, we
are proponents of responsible growth and ethical behavior.
In this report, you¡¯ll discover the many ways in which our principles of
corporate responsibility drove real-life benefts for our customers and
company in 2014. Our purchase of National Pump is a good example.
It made United Rentals the second largest provider of pump rentals
in North America?but more important, it enabled us to support our
customers in new ways with an even greater range of solutions.
A Year of Innovation
Technology is playing an ever-increasing role in our industry. We continue to
lead by example, providing our customers with equipment technologies that
are more effcient and environmentally sound. In many cases, we work with
manufacturers to ensure that their research and development efforts take into
consideration the unique safety and productivity needs of rental customersWithin our own company, we¡¯re just as diligent. Our focus on continuous
innovation led to a 2014 pilot program designed to reduce preventive
maintenance time by at least 60%. The early results are promising: our pilot
branches reduced the time it takes to perform an oil change from 51 minutes
to 21 minutes, while mitigating the environmental risk associated with oil spills.
On the customer front, we took steps to address downtime head-on.
Downtime is a frequent challenge for customers on jobsites, for a variety
of reasons. We can help increase productivity by delivering equipment on
time. Last year, our innovative Field, Automation, Strategy, Technology
(FAST) technology was instrumental in improving our on-time delivery rate
to a record 94%.
In addition, we built on our stance as a safety leader with the online launch
of United Academy. This cutting-edge training and certifcation management
center reduces the cost and complexity of equipment training. United
Academy is available to anyone who wants to sustain high safety standards
on jobsites while meeting regulatory requirements.
These are all examples of our unwavering sense of purpose as an organization.
It is further exemplifed by our United Compassion Fund, an
employee-funded, frst response program that helps fellow employees in
times of need. The Compassion Fund played an important role in our culture
in 2014, as did our continued support of military veterans and the advances
we made as a more diverse organization.
One of our company¡¯s most meaningful actions in 2014 was to make
more than 13,000 of our employees owners of United Rentals. We did this
by granting restricted stock units. It was more than a gesture of thanks
for their support?it was an acknowledgment that our employees have
an essential connection to our vision, our customers and our corporate
responsibility efforts.
While we¡¯ve made great progress against our goals, we¡¯re also eager to take
on the next challenge. United Rentals will continue to evolve with creativity
and integrity as the fagship company in our industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
619,United Rentals,4,USA,"We believe that a company is defined by the values that
guide it through major decisions and everyday actions.
That¡¯s certainly true of United Rentals. Our seven distinct
values reflect our belief that we, as a company, must
do what¡¯s right? from safety to customer service to
community involvement.
These same values dovetail with our sense of corporate
responsibility, including our environmental initiatives and our focus
on diversity and inclusion. By building this report around our
value system, we reinforce the idea that corporate responsibility
and culture are intertwined. Together, they enable us to become
a stronger company, a better employer and a more responsible
corporate citizen.
Value-driven accomplishments in 2015
Safety First is a value that permeates our company, and has made
United Rentals an industry leader in risk management and loss
prevention. In 2015, we achieved the lowest recordable rate in our
history? placing us in the top quartile of world-class companies
in all industry sectors. Another value, Passion for People, speaks to the importance of building a diverse
workplace and supplier base. We have been recognized for our inclusiveness
by three different entities: Diversity Plus magazine, Associated Builders and
Contractors, and Minority Business News USA magazine.
Our value of Continuous Innovation encourages employees to guard against
complacency. This has driven industry-firsts such as our United Academy¢ç
training and certification management center. In 2015, we introduced
United Academy¢ç mobile capabilities that enable trainees to carry their training
profile with them and access proof of certifications to show potential employers.
These are just a few of the many ways in which our values keep us true to
our mission. That is, to deploy the best people, equipment and solutions to
enable our customers to safely build a better and stronger future. Our mission is
a clear commitment to the customers who depend on us to help them succeed.
Our culture of corporate responsibility extends this commitment to the many other
stakeholders and communities we serve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
478,WalMart,2,USA,"Together, we are doing big things. I am proud to share our
2013 Global Responsibility Report with you because of what
we accomplished together this year ? and I¡¯m even more
excited to share where we are going.
We were reminded again this year that Walmart has a
responsibility to lead. We serve the emerging middle class
around the world. Our customers are concerned with kitchen
table issues, like whether they can afford to put healthier
food on the table ¡¦ whether they can save a little money for
a rainy day ¡¦ whether their kids can get a good education.Our responsibility starts with these customers. They are fighting hard for their families,
and we¡¯re fighting for them. The major challenges facing society today are too big and
too complex for any one country or sector to solve alone. Walmart must do our part to
give our customers better options and better lives.
And by working collaboratively with our many fantastic partners around the globe,
we had a productive year. Here are a few of my favorite examples:
?	 Renewable energy now provides 21 percent of Walmart¡¯s electricity globally, and we
became the largest on-site green power generator in the United States;
?	 Walmart and the Walmart Foundation are increasing training, market access and career
opportunities for nearly 1 million women worldwide;
?	 Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave more than $1 billion to support
organizations that impact local communities around the world;
?	 Walmart and the Walmart Foundation became the first partner of Feeding America to
donate 1 billion meals (since 2005);
?	 We have saved our customers $2.3 billion on fresh fruits and vegetables since 2011; and
?	 Walmart committed to hire any honorably discharged U.S. veteran in his or her first year
off active duty.
You¡¯ll find more detail on these and all of our initiatives in this report.Where we are going
We are proud of what we have accomplished,
but we know that becoming a more
sustainable and more responsible business
is a journey. And that journey continues.
We have learned that there¡¯s not always a
straight path to making big changes and that
our first idea might not always be the best
idea. We continue to adjust and improve,
while remaining focused on achieving the
results we are looking for.
This year, we saw even more
clearly where we are heading.
Going forward, you can expect even deeper
integration of our responsibility initiatives
into our business. This year, the Sustainability
Index has allowed us to put sustainability
right at the heart of what we do as a retailer
? buying and selling merchandise. The Index
will cover 400 product categories next year
and will influence the design of our privatebrand
products. We¡¯ve gone from our broad
commitment to sell more sustainable products
to putting concrete tools into the hands of
our merchants.
In many ways, we have passed a critical
threshold. Because we have taken a systemic
approach to scaling the Index, every person
in our U.S. merchandising organization now
has our responsibility initiatives as part of
her or his annual objectives. That is only
possible because they now have the tools
they need to succeed.As we move ahead, you can also expect us
to focus more on the areas with the biggest
potential to make the biggest difference. An
example is our pledge to significantly increase
the amount we source from women-owned
businesses ? including $20 billion of
products and services for the U.S. alone. This
is both where Walmart can have the biggest
impact ? through our purchase orders ? and
where we can have a huge impact on society.
Women hire other women, mentor other
women and create better communities
around them, while keeping Walmart more
connected to our customers.
We will also continue to strengthen our
leadership on an industry-wide level. After
all, what Walmart can do alone is significant,
but what we can do together is even better.
For example, our pledge to reduce salt,
sugars and fats in the food we sell is driving
changes at our suppliers and across the
food industry. In October, a grant from the
Walmart Foundation was given to help
open an office of The Sustainability
Consortium in China that will work at scale
on the sustainability of products made
in Asia ? which, by the way, will help
our competitors too. We¡¯re also making
important commitments around renewable
energy that will have ripple effects across
the green power industry.
Continued transparency
We are grateful to the hundreds, even
thousands, of community groups, nonprofits,
universities, businesses and NGOs that are
partnering with us on all of these efforts.
Building these relationships will allow us to
make our efforts sustainable and scalable,
and hopefully to set a good example for
others as well.
In these relationships and in this report,
Walmart is committed to being open,
transparent and sincere ? when we get
things right and also when we get things
wrong. We recognize that some might still
have concerns about our company, and we
try our best to address those concerns in
these pages. I want to spend a moment on
three issues that may be on your mind.
The first is around our associates. We are
proud of the jobs and opportunities we offer.
Our U.S. turnover rate is lower than the
industry average; our job satisfaction scores
are higher than the industry average, and
more than 300,000 associates have worked
with us for more than 10 years. That¡¯s in part
because at Walmart, you can climb the
ladder from a stocker or a cashier to a
department manager, a store manager and
beyond. Especially in today¡¯s economy, that
is a rare and important opportunity.
The second is the terrible tragedy in a
Bangladesh garment factory last fall. Like
you, we were saddened and disturbed by
the senseless loss of life, and we renewed
our dedication to being part of the solution.
Over the past few years, we have taken strong steps to ensure a more responsible
supply chain ? through training, ongoing
audits, and high standards for suppliers.
And we have instituted a zero-tolerance
policy: we will terminate our relationship
with any supplier engaged in unauthorized
subcontracting. This is a tough but critical
challenge ? for us and others ? and we
recognize that the immense complexity
of the supply chain requires us to partner
with peers and stakeholders to find
sustainable solutions.
The final area is compliance with the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. We are committed
to having a strong and effective global
anticorruption program everywhere we
operate and to taking appropriate action for
any instance of noncompliance at any level of
the company. We are taking a number of
specific, concrete actions with respect to our
processes, procedures and people to build a
world-class compliance program in each of
our markets. We are communicating regularly
and clearly that it is our firm expectation
that every Walmart associate will act with
integrity at all times.
A stronger business
Leading on big issues is not easy. But the
rewards are greater than we thought
possible when we set out on this journey.
We do have a responsibility to lead, and
we¡¯ve found that our responsibility is also
our opportunity.
I hope you¡¯ll see one of Walmart¡¯s core
convictions come to life in these pages ?
that what¡¯s good for society and good for
business can be one and the same. More
and more, we¡¯re finding ways to make
them mutually reinforcing.
Whether it¡¯s offering customers more
relevant products from women-owned
businesses, or supporting more domestic
manufacturing, or making the foods we sell
healthier, or cutting our costs by running
our truck fleet more efficiently, we believe
that our work on these issues makes us a
stronger business.
It drives our bottom line even more than
we had expected, but not only that ? it brings
us closer to our customers. It helps us form
strong partnerships with governments and
communities in the countries where we
work. And it reinforces our Walmart culture.
Our associates take pride in knowing they
are helping make a difference in the world.
I thank you for your time and interest in
learning about Walmart¡¯s work over the
past year and look forward to hearing your
thoughts on how we can do even better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
479,WalMart,3,USA,"Traditional costs include expenses like supplies, energy and packaging. But the net true
cost considers issues such as waste-to-landfill, greenhouse gas emissions, economic
mobility, worker safety and food safety. These are all examples of the effects production
may have on the environment, in local communities, or on the people who grow and
make what we sell.
We believe a business should strive for not just the lowest prices, but the lowest
 true cost for all. Low prices benefit customers, but low true costs benefit everyone.
To do this, we can¡¯t sit on the sidelines until after a product is made. Walmart¡¯s
role is unique. We have a large presence in the world, and with that presence comes
great opportunity to change how business is done. In addition to tackling social
and environmental issues in our own operations, we need to actively engage in and
reshape the systems in which we work.
Food is a good example. To feed a growing planet in a sustainable way, we need
to work with small and big farmers at scale. One of our initiatives is a Climate Smart
Agriculture Platform, which will help drive improvements in agricultural productivity
and fertilizer and resource use over a 10-year period. Working with our suppliers and
using The Sustainability Index, we are focused on increasing management, tracking
and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and water use on farms. We¡¯re also working
to help farmers thrive through better training, yields and income.
The world faces complicated issues across the supply chain, and there are few
easy solutions. No company can solve them alone. But by embracing responsibility
and collaboration with others, we can make a significant difference in the world that
will serve us well in the long term.In these pages, we¡¯ll share what we¡¯re doing in three main areas:
? Creating economic opportunity for our associates, suppliers and
people who work in retail and retail supply chains beyond Walmart
? Enhancing the sustainability of our operations and product supply
chains for people and the planet
? Building strong communities where we operate
Doing this work happens to be very sound business. The most important asset a
business has is the trust and respect of customers and other stakeholders. By tackling
large issues and being transparent, a business can earn that trust, and be in a much
better position than a company that focuses only on the short term. Customers love
when a company does work for them, sourcing a wide variety of products that are
produced sustainably.
By doing the right thing, a business is setting itself up for a solid and successful
future. And by focusing not just on price ? but on ¡°cost¡± as well ? a business is tackling
social and environmental sustainability at the root. That¡¯s what you¡¯ll see us lean into
further this year and in the years ahead.
Thanks for your interest in Walmart ? and please continue to work with us,
tell us what you think and help us do even better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
620,WalMart,4,USA,"Winning with customers means being actively on their side
? making their daily lives better. As we share in our Annual Report,
customers should be able to shop on their own terms ? in a great
store or club, with a quick pickup stop on the way home from
work, or with items reliably arriving at the front door. And they
want to have some money left over to put toward their priorities:
an experience together as a family, a special gift every once in a
while, or savings for a rainy day.
It¡¯s no different with how we serve society. Our customers care
about their neighbors, their communities and the planet. They
want to buy products that are good for the environment and the
people who made them. They want items that are safe and healthy
for their families. And ultimately they want to use their dollars,
pounds or yen in a way that aligns with their values and has an
impact on the world. So we are not only advocating for customers
when we offer low prices and convenience, but also when we help
positively reshape the ways items are made, shipped and sold.
When we get it right, customers are able to shop at ease, knowing
we did the work for them. They know that the products on our
shelves and website were produced at a low ¡°true cost¡± for
all ? not just in terms of being the best value, but in terms of
whether they enhance the environment and the lives of all the
people who helped produce them.
As you¡¯ll see in these pages, we have made significant progress
toward the three big goals we laid out in 2005: to create zero
waste, run on 100 percent renewable energy and sell products that
sustain people and the environment. What¡¯s even more exciting
is that we¡¯ve also expanded their scope, as the supply chain is
proving to be the biggest tool we have. It¡¯s been said that ¡°supply
chain is strategy,¡± and that¡¯s true ? it¡¯s our opportunity to get things
to customers in a timely, cost-effective and sustainable way. The
individual choices we make along the supply chain greatly impact
the future for all of us.
So what was once largely about our own operations has shifted
into helping rewire whole systems: Running on renewable energy
has turned into joining the global effort to combat climate change;
reducing waste has evolved into seeking a circular economy in
which materials can be continually recycled; and selling sustainable
products has broadened into working with suppliers and others
throughout the supply chain to reduce impacts at every stage.
And beyond sustainability, we¡¯ve undertaken journeys to enhance
economic opportunity inside Walmart and beyond and to
strengthen the communities in which we operate and source.
Today we view global responsibility in these three big areas ?
Opportunity, Sustainability and Community. All three cut to the
heart of customer advocacy and leveraging our supply chain.
We don¡¯t pretend for a moment that we have this all figured out.
The issues are complex, and the work is difficult. But our role
is to get up every day, roll up our sleeves and lead. As we do,
we¡¯re thankful to be joined by so many great suppliers, NGOs,
community groups and other stakeholders.
Ultimately, we believe that serving customers and society is the
same thing. You can¡¯t have one without the other because, in
the long term, their interests converge. Putting the customer first
means delivering for them in ways that protect and preserve the
communities they live in and the world they¡¯ll pass on to future
generations.
When you put it all together, we¡¯ll enable customers around the
world to save money and time, so they can invest more of both in
the things they love. And we¡¯ll help make the world a better place
one community at a time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
482,Wells Fargo,2,USA,"At Wells Fargo, we believe our responsibility as a corporation
goes beyond protecting our customers¡¯ assets and helping them
succeed financially. We want to help create long-term economic
growth and quality of life in our communities. As our business and
communities have expanded globally, so has our role to lead by
example and make a difference through our ongoing corporate social
responsibility efforts.
Our nation¡¯s economic recovery hasn¡¯t been fast or
broad enough. Unemployment remains stubbornly
high. Some housing markets are still struggling
to recover. Millions of individuals, businesses and
communities, including many of the customers we
serve, continue to suffer in the real economy. We hear
from them every day in our local banking stores, on
our phone lines and over the internet. We also hear
with increasing frequency from community groups,
elected officials, and other stakeholders who want us
to take a bigger role in solving broad-based social,
economic and environmental challenges.
We support the real economy in many ways,
including enabling people to buy new homes,
providing needed capital for business investment and
expansion, and helping consumers plan for retirement
and a more sustainable future. In this report, you¡¯ll
read about some of the important work our company
is doing to actively support the revitalization and
growth of the economy, including in our hardest-hit
communities. You¡¯ll also find stories about how we
are operating our company in a responsible way, with
an increased focus on integrating environmental and
social practices into our business strategies, products,
operations and supply chain.
Throughout our history, Wells Fargo has been
committed to supporting the communities in which
our team members and customers live and work.
Now, more than ever, corporate social responsibility
is a driving force in our business. In fact, one of our
company¡¯s six strategic priorities, which I invite
you to read about in our 2013 Annual Report, is
¡°connecting with communities and stakeholders.¡±
We understand the importance of reaching out
and engaging in conversations with many interested
parties every day???listening and understanding,
doing what¡¯s right, and, when we make mistakes,
admitting them and learning from them.

621,Wells Fargo,4,USA,"Since our founding in 1852, we have focused on a few core
principles: Putting our customers first and helping them
succeed financially. Valuing and supporting our team members.
Investing in our communities. Strengthening the economy.
These principles form the foundation of how Wells Fargo
conducts business. We invest in relationships that endure
? with our customers, communities, team members, and
shareholders. In short, we are a relationship company.
Our relationships are the inspiration for Wells Fargo¡¯s
2015 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, Earning lifelong
relationships: Creating solutions for stronger communities.
The report highlights our efforts during the year to create
more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable communities around
the world while we continue to pursue our vision to ¡°satisfy our
customers¡¯ financial needs and help them succeed financially.¡±
As a Main Street bank, we understand the challenges that
communities face. Many individuals and families continue
to struggle due to the uneven economic recovery. Rising housing
costs are putting greater pressure on low- and moderate-income
families who lost wealth during the economic downturn. Millions
of people lack jobs that offer the prospect of economic mobility
? with even wider disparities in diverse communities. With the
effects of climate change, environmental sustainability is of
growing importance.
To succeed as a global business, we must help strengthen
the communities we serve and address these challenges.
Our broad portfolio of products and services positions us
to have a positive impact on people, businesses, and the
broader economy when and where it matters most, whether
it's buying a home, paying for college, starting a business,
managing unexpected life events, planning for the future,
or leaving a positive legacy. Wells Fargo, and our corporate social responsibility
(CSR) efforts, experienced another solid year in 2015.
Our results, which you¡¯ll read about throughout this
report, are in many ways a tribute to our focus
on putting customers first in everything we do.
We believe that our long-standing
focus on caring for our customers
sets us apart, and it's been a key
contributor to our company's
success and stability since 1852.
Earning lifelong relationships is fundamental to our
ability to create solutions to social, economic, and
environmental challenges; strengthen communities;
and grow local economies around the world. We¡¯ve put
those relationships to work in a number of areas:
? Since 2007, Wells Fargo has provided $4 million
in grants to GRID Alternatives ? a nonprofit that
makes renewable energy and job training accessible
to low-income communities. Our funding helped
the organization expand services from its home
in California to locations across the U.S. Thanks
to Wells Fargo team members who volunteered
to install solar panels, 50 homeowners like Karen
Spotted Tail (see page 52), a member of the Rosebud
Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, have been able
to significantly reduce their energy costs.
? As the economy recovers, we continue working
with nonprofits and housing agencies to stabilize
neighborhoods by providing loan modifications,
credit counseling, and other programs to prevent
foreclosures and keep people in their homes.
Through our LIFT programs, we¡¯ve provided
more than $278 million in down payment
assistance and homebuyer education during the
past four years to help more than 10,725 people and
families in 39 communities buy homes. The result:
Stronger low- to moderate-income neighborhoods.
? We¡¯ve had a long and rich history with United Way,
which includes engaging team members in our
annual Community Support Campaign. In 2015,
team members contributed $98.8 million
to more than 30,000 nonprofits and schools,
and United Way ranked our workplace-giving
campaign the largest in the U.S. for the seventh
year in a row. We also work with local United Way
chapters as part of our five-year, $5 million effort
to bring financial education and resources to lowand
moderate-income communities. I hope you¡¯ll
read on page 35 about our work with United Way
of Metropolitan Chicago to revitalize one of the
city¡¯s most economically challenged neighborhoods.
Every day we strive to earn the trust and respect of the
customers and communities we serve. We believe that
our long-standing focus on caring for our customers sets
us apart, and it¡¯s been a key contributor to our company¡¯s
success and stability since 1852. Over the past year
we¡¯ve taken steps to further strengthen our focus
on that culture, introducing what we call the
Culture of Caring? ? a new vehicle for talking with
our team members about how our unique culture and
the way each of us behaves contribute to our success.
We also introduced the Office of Global Ethics
and Integrity team (see page 69), which is building
a consistent approach to managing ethical risk and
to helping our company maintain the highest standards
of ethical behavior in everything we do. The team
is also tasked with putting in place measures to hold
us accountable for improvement ? as individuals and
as an organization.
None of the progress we¡¯re reporting here would
be possible without our 265,0001 Wells Fargo team
members worldwide who bring our Culture of Caring
focus to life each day through the ethics and integrity
that guide their work and through the connections they
build within our local communities. In 2015, our team
members volunteered 1.8 million hours to nonprofits
and causes important to them.
My thanks to our team members, community partners,
suppliers, and other stakeholders for all you do to help
us build strong, healthy communities. We accomplished,
and will continue to accomplish, so much together!

483,Western Union,1,USA,"Western Union is a complex global business, and
our ability to manage this complexity is one core
strength. Yet, in some ways our business is very
simple: it¡¯s all about the needs of our customers.
A mother of four in the Philippines who puts her
children through school with the money she receives
from her husband working on a ship at sea. An Indian
student in London who has one less thing to worry
about now that his tuition is paid reliably and on time
through our GlobalPay for Students platform. An
entrepreneur in Canada who can make payments to
import the materials she needs from China through
our efficient payment system. A woman in Mexico
who relies on our service to receive funds for food
and medicine. We make life a bit better for all of our
customers. We help them grow.
Our market is growing, too. Yet, recent years have
posed challenges, including an evolving compliance
and regulatory environment, economic softness
in parts of the world, and competitive pressures
in some areas of our business. As we publish this
report, I am optimistic that our business is heading
in a positive direction, with a purpose that has never
been clearer.
Western Union promotes financial inclusion by
giving people and organizations better ways to move
money across borders in more than 120 currencies.
We help create global economic opportunity and
growth for individuals, businesses, communities
and economies.
Our customer commitment includes consumer
protection and empowerment programs, and
innovative services delivered through multiple,
integrated channels. We strive to allow our consumers
to access our services anytime, anywhere, any way
they need to meet their financial needs and achieve
their full potential.
We connect millions of senders and receivers, and
100,000*
 Western Union Business Solutions clients,
to more than 500,000 Agent locations,*
 more than100,000 ATMs,*
 and millions of mobile phones,
tablets and computers worldwide.
Our remitters are heroes in their families and
communities. Others are business pioneers. Still
others play a vital role as leaders of nonprofit, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), or academic
or healthcare institutions. Yet, they all have needs
that are not well met by traditional financial services
firms, and they recognize and trust the Western
Union brand.
In 2013, $82 billion was sent between consumers
through the Western Union system. We create growth
by moving money for better. To us, that means both
responsible corporate operations as well as offering
products and services that create shared value ?
simultaneously driving revenue and benefiting
society. Western Union¢ç services make a difference
in the lives of millions of people, businesses and
communities every day. I am very proud of that fact.
But our commitment to our customers and
communities doesn¡¯t end there. Launched in 2007,
Western Union¡¯s Our World, Our Family¢ç program
made a five-year, $50 million commitment to
fostering global economic opportunity. In 2012, we reached both milestones, having touched five
million lives.
As we analyzed the program¡¯s success, we realized
that education was one of the surest paths to a better
life. That is why in 2012, we announced ¡°Education
for Better,¡± a three-year commitment to grow young
minds and help meet global education goals. I hope
you will take a moment to read about this important
effort and to join us in this global cause. These efforts stem from our deep commitment to
Western Union customers and communities. We
have long been committed to doing what¡¯s right,
not just what¡¯s easy. We stand up for our customers
and create opportunity through essential products
and services, ethical governance and a culture of
compliance, efficient operations and a long-standing
community commitment.
Our business is good for society. We help create
jobs, help grow the global economy and move
money for better. I believe this is the true meaning of
responsibility, and I am pleased to share highlights
of our progress through this report.

485,Weyerhaeuser,3,USA,"Every day, Weyerhaeuser employees work hard to make sure our company continues to thrive and grow ? just like our forests. We discuss our progress here on our website, rather than publishing a printed report. We invite you to look around and learn more. When Frederick Weyerhaeuser founded our company 115 years ago, he said: ""This is not for us, nor for our children, but for our grandchildren."" He was talking about the timberland he had purchased, and the need to be responsible by replanting after harvest so our forests would last forever. He didn¡¯t use the word ¡°sustainability¡± ? no one did back then ? but he did instill the concept of long-term thinking into our company DNA. Today, sustainability is a core value at Weyerhaeuser and it means much more than planting trees, although we continue to do that as well, and have planted nearly 350 million seedlings in the last five years.
 To us, sustainability means making smart choices that balance the demands of today with the needs of tomorrow to ensure our company lasts for another hundred years or more. For all companies, that starts with being profitable. If our business is not successful, we will not endure, and we have made great progress in the last year to improve our financial performance through relentless focus on operational excellence. The work we do to improve efficiency and reduce cost often has an environmental benefit as well. We¡¯ve set a number of goals in areas such as waste reduction (less volume to landfills), energyefficiency (less reliance on fossil fuels), and water-use reduction (less heating and treating). Through these initiatives, we continue to make solid progress to minimize our impact on the environment in which we operate. Perhaps most critical to our long-term success is the need to attract and retain the best and brightest talent. Weyerhaeuser has always attracted great people, and our voluntary turnover rate is very low, but like many companies, we¡¯re facing a retirement cliff. To ensure our internal talent bench is strong, we have intensified our focus on people development. We believe the promise of great career growth as part of a winning team ? built on a foundation of solid company values ? is what will help us retain the talented employees we have today and attract new employees who are interested in making a difference. It all comes back to our company vision: Working together to grow a truly great company for our shareholders, customers and employees. To us, this means creating a great place to work, achieving great financial results and making a great contribution to society. Our goal is to do all three really well, all the time. When we accomplish that, we will be living up to the vision of our founder, who never used the word sustainability, but who certainly intended to build a company that would last. Thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. After you've explored our report, please take a few moments to provide your feedback. Your input will help us become a truly great company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
